1k79cgi,Tips for experiencing the REAL Seoul (from a local who's tired of seeing tourists in overpriced traps),739,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1k79cgi/tips_for_experiencing_the_real_seoul_from_a_local/,1745545608.0,"Hi, my last post was bit promotional and I'm very sorry about that. So I just thougt I might as well just post all the good spots for you guys to visit anyways.

I'm a 26-year-old Korean who grew up here but spent 15+ years studying in the UK. I've been following this sub and wanted to share some insider tips to help visitors experience Seoul like locals do.

Edit1: I have included many places in Itaewon because honestly they are really nice. You can always have a similar experience else where in Seoul but there are too many of them for me to post it in one go. Sorry for not keeping up to the standard for some people. Just wanted help lol So Added bunch more to the list and I will keep on adding it so people will be satistified one day!""

Edit2: If you think Taxi in Korea is cheap, then just use it! Why walk around when you have the money to spend?Korean Public transports are great so you can always experience what it is like traveling around in trains and bus. Naver map will take care of you. 

# Teach A Man To Fish

Also Since, people are complaining that Seoul is Massive and I have not listed all of the best spots, let me teach you to find the best places, this is the method I use most of the times when finding new spot.

Naver Review is rigged as hell so you shouldn't trust those 4.9 5.0 reviews.

Get a KAKAO MAP, and use that to search for the spot. Kakao MAP is usually less rigged and I failed maybe once or twice because of the fake reviews. Just search type of food you want to eat in korean, like 국밥, 돼지갈비, 닭갈비, 삼겹살 etc (just use googe translator i guess), and go to places with 20+ reviews with 4.0+ rating. You won't fail.

# Important note: These are my personal recommendations based on places I genuinely enjoy, and by no means should this be treated as a ""must follow"" guide. I encourage everyone to do their own research and not rely solely on this list. That said, I can confidently say you'll have a wonderful time at these places. I haven't included Korean traditional food restaurants (한식) because there are many good sources on the internet for these and there are simply too many excellent options to choose from.

Also I have excluded some of the restaurants where it is really hard to reserve or you have to wait for 1-2 hours because I thnk it is waste of time standing in the line when you can do more exploring around the city!

I should also mention that the itineraries people have been posting in this sub are mostly really good, so I'm not going to focus on recommending tourist attractions. The standard recommendations like Gyeongbok Palace, Korean National Museum, 한옥마을 (Hanok Village), and 광장시장 (Gwangjang Market) are all worthwhile stops that are well-covered in existing guides.

# Common tourist mistakes:

* **Myeongdong restaurants** \- Most are overpriced tourist traps. You're paying 2-3x what locals pay.
* **Itaewon BBQ** \- As someone who lives here, I see tourists flocking to places no Korean would ever eat at.
* **Missing authentic food delivery** \- Most Koreans order amazing street food through apps (which unfortunately require Korean phone numbers/language). **But! you can still go to their store without the delivery!**
* **Taxi problems** \- Getting taxis on weekend nights is nearly impossible even with apps - plan accordingly! Gangnam/Itaewon/Hongdae

# Activities you guys might add to your trip:

* **Sunrise hikes** \- One of Seoul's best experiences is hiking up mountains to catch the sunrise. Bring ramyeon to eat at the summit
   * Search -""북한산 일출산행"" in google, and you will see what this is about.
   * There is a mountain North West of Seoul called 북한산 - ""Bukhansan Mountatin"" and it is popular place to go hiking in Seoul. But what is getting really popular recently is that people would go there 4am in the morning, and reach the summit before the sun rise, and see the whole Seoul from the top of the mountain with the wonderful view. I went there with my girlfriend and it was absolutely amazing experience.
* **Korean baseball games** \- The atmosphere is incredible and totally different from Western sports events. Eating Korean Fried Chicken with Beer whilst watching the game is one of many Korean people's bucket list.
* **Waterparks and Wakeboarding (빠지)** \- During summer, these are amazing spots that many tourists miss. Skip the dirty areas on the Han River and head to proper facilities outside the city. Search for ""가평 플라잉피쉬"" (Gapyeong Flying Fish) to see what I mean! Locals typically make a weekend of it - learn wakeboarding, waterski, or try various water rides during the day, then stay overnight at a ""팬션"" (pension/accommodation) provided by the facility (for an additional fee). The best part is the evening BBQ where you grill meat over charcoal (숯) while drinking beer and soju with friends. It's the perfect Korean summer experience - activities, food, drinks, and waking up with a hangover before heading back to the city!
* **Local delivery food** \- If you make Korean friends, ask them to help you order. The food that arrives at your door is often better than what you'll find in tourist areas. This is very important aspect of Korean Culture. People order food everywhere. You can even order Korean Fried Chicken to Han River, and have a picnic during the day, or chill during the evening by the river!
* **Banpo Hangang Park at night** \- Go to experience the famous ""Hangang Ramyeon"" - eating instant noodles by the river is actually a bucket list item for many Koreans who don't live in Seoul! There's also a popular chicken place nearby, so you can enjoy both. It's a simple but quintessential Seoul experience that tourists often miss. Also there are water show on Banpo Bridge durin the summer nights so it is definetly worth visiting! [https://maps.app.goo.gl/1SauDGExGeCX7pAB6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1SauDGExGeCX7pAB6)

# Recommended Place to visit for shopping clothes!

There places are popular among young people in Korea. If you have a specific Brand you are looking for, you can always search them on google :) or just go to big department stores. If you go to Shinsegae Gangnam, B1 floor is quite fun to look around :) Bit expensivee (because it is department store in Seoul xd). It is usually very crowded so bear that in mind. [https://g.co/kgs/n4Szx1D](https://g.co/kgs/n4Szx1D)

**Hannam-dong** \- Between Itaewon Station and Hangangjin Station!

**Songsu-dong** \- Place is massive so you might wanna look up the spots! But more popular areas are around here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/uBbgpdxQhqc87uP89](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uBbgpdxQhqc87uP89) After your time in this area, you can go to hanriver near by and have a look around

Yeonnam Dong is really nice as well, nice small shops and restaurants with good vibe. It is next to Hongdae so look it up!

# Korean Restaurants (my personal recommendations there may great places I have yet to visit!):

Over the past years, I've accumulated knowledge of the best restaurants for literally every type of cuisine. I see many visitors going to places I've never even heard of (and that's a bad sign). Here's a list of genuine local spots that will set you up for an amazing culinary experience in Seoul ( I will post spots mainly in Itaewon. But if you wanna know the best spots in other area, ask in the comments!)

# Itaewon -Korean BBQ Places

* **잠수교집** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/BX8gEZe)) - This is a popular Korean pork BBQ place with a unique style. It's different from ""traditional"" Korean BBQ because they serve very thinly sliced frozen pork that's absolutely amazing. I personally go there 2-3 times a month.
* **무쇠김치삼겹 한남점** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/nvMeuGR)) - This place is absolutely incredible. Not only will you get Instagram-worthy photos, but the food is just unbelievable. If you want to try proper Korean BBQ with authentic kimchi and tofu sides, you need to visit this spot.
* **24시뼈다귀감자탕** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/rheopqB)) - Famous for their 감자탕 (pork bone and potato stew). Just a heads-up that it can be spicy for foreign visitors. While Koreans might not consider it very spicy, it might be challenging if you're not used to Korean spice levels.

# Itaewon - Korean Drinking Experience

* **역전할머니맥주** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/F4BjcQa)) - A famous pub franchise in Korea known for their beers served in frozen beer glasses.

* **Carlos' Bar** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/u2u3tdu)) - The atmosphere is very chill, and the owner is super friendly. Good drinks and vibes. One of the best bars in Itaewon.
* **Bar Jangsaeng** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/LQsKMgx)) - A very nice bar with cocktails featuring Korean twists! Definitely recommended for a visit.

# Korean-Chinese Food - My Soul Food

* **면사무소** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/3aqf3V9)) - This is my absolute soul food spot for 짜장면 (black bean sauce noodles) and 탕수육 (sweet and sour pork). Korean-Chinese food is a unique fusion cuisine that every visitor should try!
* **청** ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DuJbm6P5rVrhFqLA9)) - If you want to try high-end Korean-Chinese food, this is the place. Google may show it as closed, but it's definitely open and worth visiting for an elevated experience of these classic dishes.
* **JS Garden** ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qHXqXDxgSrKU52tE9)) - For those looking for a truly premium Korean-Chinese dining experience, this high-end restaurant offers exceptional quality and ambiance.

# Korean Fried Chicken - A Must Try!

* **Nekkid Wings** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/3XBHuY6)) - Hands down the best Korean fried chicken in Seoul. Just look at the platter they serve you and you'll immediately want to go there. I go here when ever I wanna treat my self with some chicken!
* **BBQ 황금올리브 치킨** \- Most Koreans actually eat delivered franchise chicken (which is still amazing). This is the best non-sauce Korean fried chicken available. It's literally the best of the best franchise option.
* **깐부치킨** \- Another excellent dine-in Korean Fried Chicken franchise worth trying.
* **인생맥주** \- If you want to try traditional Korean fried chicken in a pub setting, this is the place to go!

# Lamb Spots in Itaewon

* **일거양득** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/XcZqjpo)) - If you like lamb, you must try this place.
* **이태원양꼬** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/qAGSVdo)) - Amazing lamb skewers restaurant. Be sure to order 꿔바로우 (crispy sweet and sour pork) with fried rice and plenty of beers for the full experience.
* **이치류** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/X1UVy9U)) - For a more high-end Korean lamb BBQ experience. Can be expensive but worth it for lamb lovers.

# Dakgalbi (Korean Spicy Chicken) - Two Must-Try Styles

* **숯불 닭갈비 (Grilled Dakgalbi)** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/9wJVwf1)) - This is the classic version where marinated chicken pieces are grilled on a hot plate with vegetables, rice cakes, and sweet potato. It's often cooked at your table.
* **춘천 닭갈비 (Stir-fried Dakgalbi)** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/Vn6r7T1)) - This is the Chuncheon-style dakgalbi, where the marinated chicken and ingredients are stir-fried on a large flat pan. It's typically spicier and often eaten with cheese. People usually order fried rice (볶음밥) at the end, made by stir-frying rice with the remaining sauce on the pan.

# My Personal Favorite BBQ Places

* **풍년집** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/Cfr8x6w)) - Very affordable Korean beef BBQ place. I go here all the time when I want to have beef. The food is on point, and the staff members are extremely friendly.
* **사당돈** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/FqVAf8X)) - In my opinion, the best Korean BBQ place in Seoul. Their 삼겹살 (pork belly) is on another level compared to other places.
* **신사모소리** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/BnSkosJ)) - Another one of my favorite spots! Their cabbage salad which you eat with pork belly is on a godly level. Absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it.

For those willing to spend more for premium dining experiences, here are some exceptional high-end options:

# Premium Korean Beef

# Fresh Seafood Market

* **노량진수산시장** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/6XXHxZo)) - This is Seoul's largest seafood market where you can have an amazing experience. You can select your own fresh fish and have it prepared as sashimi right on the spot! Important disclaimer: you need to research good stalls there since some can be overpriced, but there are plenty with reasonable prices. This is a very unique food adventure that many tourists miss. Locals sometimes go their to get cheap fresh fish because sashimi can be quite expensive in restaurants. But if this is too much of hassle you can also just have it else where!

# Korean Dumplings (Mandu)

* **깡통만두** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/rPWCRgN)) - A great spot for authentic Korean dumplings. Mandu is a Korean comfort food that's definitely worth trying during your visit.

Honestly, If you just try the above restaurants, you are literally set for your trip. When my friends visited from Uk, I just took them to those places and they loved every single moment of it.

If you want an information on Spanish, Italian, Maxican Restaurants etc, feel free to ask me in the comments or DM me!

# Practical tips:

* Restaurant reservations often require Korean phone numbers/apps
* Concert/sports tickets sell out incredibly fast - plan WAY ahead
* Many of the best experiences require Korean language skills or having local connections
* Transportation is complicated during the off hours ""12pm to 5am"" and taxis are nearly impossible to catch - have backup plans
* Use Naver Map/Kakao map instead of Google. You will have much better experience navigating around Korea in public transport.

I hope this helps some of you plan better trips! Feel free to ask questions in the comments and if you want more specific advice, you can just dm me.

What are your favorite hidden gems you've discovered in Korea? Would love to hear other recommendations to share with friends who visit!

This took me like 4 hours to make but if you guys keep commenting and recommend or suggest something I will add more to the list!",134,Places to Visit,"Hmm, not sure why you’re not emphasizing the use of public transportation but it’s not that complicated as long as you have NAVER maps and you take your time identifying the right platform. 


I also feel like “many of the best experiences require Korean…” point is not true. You can still experience many authentic and wonderful experiences as long as you do your research ahead of time.


And Korea is not just about BBQ, meat, and drinking! Majority of your spots are for this but there’s such a huge variety from cold noodles, gimbap, raw crab, fresh seafood, bibimbap, etc. I hope tourists come and experience more Korean cuisine rather than cuisines of Spain, Italy, or Mexico. | >I see many visitors going to places I've never even heard of (and that's a bad sign).


I appreciate your dedication in making this post, but dude what a stretch. Seoul is huge. | While I always appreciate recommendations, I have to say as a non-Korean speaking tourist in Korea for the first time, I’ve actually preferred my dining experiences in and around the tourist traps.

When I went to the ‘real’ Korea places I had all sorts of issues navigating anywhere, translating/communicating, and knowing what I was ordering. The tourist ‘traps’ (which I’ll add are nowhere near as bad as other, bigger cities I’ve been to around the world) are actually very accommodating and welcoming to non-Korean speaking tourists.

Not to mention it stimulates the cities economy far far more effectively to have people go to those areas. Local residents should be glad of their existence. If no one went to then no one would make any money from tourists and your favourite spots would be far too overcrowded. | The format of your guide is very good, but the content is a garbage guide for tourists, though it might be somewhat helpful for foreign students living here.  
Tourists come here looking for experiences, and they’re willing to pay for them.  
Most won’t even remember how much they spent  
  
Water activities are available in pretty much every country, so they’re not really worth the time if you're only in Korea for 10 days.  
  
Halmaek and Insaengmaeju are probably the worst bars in the country, serving cheap disgusting beer that only broke students drink. At least insaeng is more stylish.  
I think you’re forgetting that most tourists aren’t tight on budget.

This sub has a hard time to accept Myeongdeong, Palaces, Insadong etc... are working because that's the Korea people **want** to see. People want to see the Korea that is sold to them through ads and medias.

I hate Myeongdeong and places around, not a big fan of the food market either. But I'd recommend tourists to go there 100000x times, as they will definitely find what they are looking for. Going out of that way will lack convenience.

For someone living here longer, and on a budget, your guide might be more interesting and we could pick up one or two names from it. | Google maps recommendations?!?!  You should know that’s it’s garbage.  Have to use kakao, T, or Naver maps in Korea","Tips for experiencing the REAL Seoul (from a local who's tired of seeing tourists in overpriced traps) Hi, my last post was bit promotional and I'm very sorry about that.

It's typically spicier and often eaten with cheese. People usually order fried rice (볶음밥) at the end, made by stir-frying rice with the remaining sauce on the pan.

# My Personal Favorite BBQ Places

* **풍년집** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/Cfr8x6w)) - Very affordable Korean beef BBQ place. I go here all the time when I want to have beef. The food is on point, and the staff members are extremely friendly.
* **사당돈** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/FqVAf8X)) - In my opinion, the best Korean BBQ place in Seoul. Their 삼겹살 (pork belly) is on another level compared to other places.
* **신사모소리** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/BnSkosJ)) - Another one of my favorite spots! Their cabbage salad which you eat with pork belly is on a godly level. Absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it.

# High-End Restaurant Recommendations

For those willing to spend more for premium dining experiences, here are some exceptional high-end options:

# Premium Korean Beef

* **우미돈블랙** ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jxRXZZcdgTNHTSrV6)) - Outstanding premium Korean beef experience.
* **이속후화** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/d3KzukT)) - Exceptional high-end beef restaurant.
* **벽제갈비** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/9jn9Eec)) - Famous for premium quality galbi (beef ribs).
* **삼원가든** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/zZrsWNn)) - A classic upscale Korean beef restaurant with excellent quality.

# Premium Sushi

* **스시윤슬** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/ELJ5eKV)) - Exceptional sushi experience.
* **스시노아야** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/UgZZk1r)) - High-end sushi with meticulous preparation.
* **더나인클럽** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/7z2hrns)) - Premium sushi in an elegant setting.
* **하네** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/raLXBLw)) - Authentic very high-end Japanese sushi experience.

# Traditional Korean Soup

* **농민백암순대** ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/87eFVHRH34Fp1yJu8)) - Great place for 국밥 (gukbap, traditional Korean soup with rice). Even as someone who isn't typically a fan of gukbap, I found this place really nice.# Tips for experiencing the REAL Seoul (from a local who's tired of seeing tourists in overpriced traps)

# Fresh Seafood Market

* **노량진수산시장** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/6XXHxZo)) - This is Seoul's largest seafood market where you can have an amazing experience. You can select your own fresh fish and have it prepared as sashimi right on the spot! Important disclaimer: you need to research good stalls there since some can be overpriced, but there are plenty with reasonable prices. This is a very unique food adventure that many tourists miss. Locals sometimes go their to get cheap fresh fish because sashimi can be quite expensive in restaurants. But if this is too much of hassle you can also just have it else where!

# Korean Dumplings (Mandu)

* **깡통만두** ([Google Maps](https://g.co/kgs/rPWCRgN)) - A great spot for authentic Korean dumplings. Mandu is a Korean comfort food that's definitely worth trying during your visit.

Honestly, If you just try the above restaurants, you are literally set for your trip. When my friends visited from Uk, I just took them to those places and they loved every single moment of it.

If you want an information on Spanish, Italian, Maxican Restaurants etc, feel free to ask me in the comments or DM me!

# Practical tips:

* Restaurant reservations often require Korean phone numbers/apps
* Concert/sports tickets sell out incredibly fast - plan WAY ahead
* Many of the best experiences require Korean language skills or having local connections
* Transportation is complicated during the off hours ""12pm to 5am"" and taxis are nearly impossible to catch - have backup plans
* Use Naver Map/Kakao map instead of Google. You will have much better experience navigating around Korea in public transport.

I hope this helps some of you plan better trips! Feel free to ask questions in the comments and if you want more specific advice, you can just dm me.

What are your favorite hidden gems you've discovered in Korea? Would love to hear other recommendations to share with friends who visit!

This took me like 4 hours to make but if you guys keep commenting and recommend or suggest something I will add more to the list! Hmm, not sure why you’re not emphasizing the use of public transportation but it’s not that complicated as long as you have NAVER maps and you take your time identifying the right platform. 


I also feel like “many of the best experiences require Korean…” point is not true. You can still experience many authentic and wonderful experiences as long as you do your research ahead of time.


And Korea is not just about BBQ, meat, and drinking! Majority of your spots are for this but there’s such a huge variety from cold noodles, gimbap, raw crab, fresh seafood, bibimbap, etc. I hope tourists come and experience more Korean cuisine rather than cuisines of Spain, Italy, or Mexico. | >I see many visitors going to places I've never even heard of (and that's a bad sign).


I appreciate your dedication in making this post, but dude what a stretch. Seoul is huge. | While I always appreciate recommendations, I have to say as a non-Korean speaking tourist in Korea for the first time, I’ve actually preferred my dining experiences in and around the tourist traps.

When I went to the ‘real’ Korea places I had all sorts of issues navigating anywhere, translating/communicating, and knowing what I was ordering. The tourist ‘traps’ (which I’ll add are nowhere near as bad as other, bigger cities I’ve been to around the world) are actually very accommodating and welcoming to non-Korean speaking tourists.

Not to mention it stimulates the cities economy far far more effectively to have people go to those areas. Local residents should be glad of their existence. If no one went to then no one would make any money from tourists and your favourite spots would be far too overcrowded. | The format of your guide is very good, but the content is a garbage guide for tourists, though it might be somewhat helpful for foreign students living here.  
Tourists come here looking for experiences, and they’re willing to pay for them.  
Most won’t even remember how much they spent  
  
Water activities are available in pretty much every country, so they’re not really worth the time if you're only in Korea for 10 days.  
  
Halmaek and Insaengmaeju are probably the worst bars in the country, serving cheap disgusting beer that only broke students drink. At least insaeng is more stylish.  
I think you’re forgetting that most tourists aren’t tight on budget.

This sub has a hard time to accept Myeongdeong, Palaces, Insadong etc... are working because that's the Korea people **want** to see. People want to see the Korea that is sold to them through ads and medias.

I hate Myeongdeong and places around, not a big fan of the food market either. But I'd recommend tourists to go there 100000x times, as they will definitely find what they are looking for. Going out of that way will lack convenience.

For someone living here longer, and on a budget, your guide might be more interesting and we could pick up one or two names from it. | Google maps recommendations?!?!  You should know that’s it’s garbage.  Have to use kakao, T, or Naver maps in Korea"
1i9zzv0,A Comprehensive List of Good Tasting Restaurants For every District in Seoul,483,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1i9zzv0/a_comprehensive_list_of_good_tasting_restaurants/,1737847224.0,"Hi! A native Korean coming to help because I see a lot of people making the same exact mistake. I see a lot of tourists in Korea going to mid-to-low quality restaurants, which, I see, ruins the potentially wonderful experiences you can have in Korea. This is mainly due to going to restaurants you saw on social media (which has a high chance of being an ad) or going into a place that seems like a good restaurant without doing the research. The gap between a low quality and high quality restaurant is huge and will definitely be a make or break for the good Korean experience you guys all want. You must do your research before you go into a restaurant (and know when a restaurant you see online is because of an ad/viral post). 

I know that this process is very tedious as it often even makes me overwhelmed… just to have a good meal. Because I didn’t want others to suffer from this process, I did all the research and made a comprehensive list (without any of the ads/virals) for all of the high quality restaurants in Seoul. It has restaurants for every single neighborhood. They are bookmarked in Naver Maps, which I highly recommend you guys get since it will make it much easier to navigate (especially if you guys are traveling without a tour guide). Google Maps is also fine to use when navigating, but I find that Google Maps is sometimes not updated for certain locations (new restaurants/bars, etc..). But its totally fine to just view the list with Chrome/Safari without installing the app.

I divided it into two lists because Seoul is huge and one list went over capacity when I tried to save all of it. You can also save the bookmarks by logging in. This way, the list would be loaded automatically when you open the app. You won’t need to pull the link up every time.

In addition, other restaurants that made it to the list but I didn’t include because they’re everywhere and franchised are:

* Mom’s Touch (맘스터치): this is a Chicken-Burger Franchise that I absolutely love going to. It’s not the typical chicken burger as you can taste like the korean style chicken inside the burger. There are tons of them everywhere, so I really recommend going there when you see one!
* Myungrang Hotdog (명량 핫도그): This is where the k-hotdog (even though its closer to a corndog) started from. The difference from the typical corndog is that the outside is crispy instead of soft, so it adds the extra texture that makes it really good. You can even put various extra toppings on the corndog (such as potato bites). Definitely try as a snack after a meal!
* Kyochon Chicken (교촌치킨): A lot of you guys (If you like korean-style chicken) might be familiar with this one. But there is a reason why this place is so popular. Despite it having a lot of criticisms in Korea for raising it’s price rapidly, it is still preferred for the best flavored (seasoned) chicken for a lot of us. Worth it imo

I also have a spreadsheet/excel file of the list (with my personal ratings), and I’m in the process of translating from Korean to English.

1ko9vox,"My far too long ""everything you need to know when visiting South Korea"" trip report",469,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1ko9vox/my_far_too_long_everything_you_need_to_know_when/,1747424526.0,"I recently had the opportunity to spend four weeks on holiday in South Korea with my wife. We loved it. And what’s better than to share that love with everyone here? Here is everything i learned from visiting the land of the morning calm, and what you should know as well.

# Context

My wife and I (we’re both in our fourties) traveled around South Korea around April 2025. I mostly limit my tips to ‘things to do and see’, because restaurants and hotels change so quickly. You can read more about how we found lodging and restaurants later in this post.

# TL;DR

All of these points will be elaborated in more detail later on in this post.

*Essentials*

* Bring a **creditcard**.
* Install the **Naver** app.
* Get an eSim with a **dataplan**.
* Get the **T-money card**.

*Itinerary*  
We had four weeks and could have seen much more, there’s just so much to see and explore! These are the cities we visited in the order of recommendation.

* You’ll probably fly in and out of **Seoul**. Seoul is gigantic, and you’ll need at least three full days to see a selection of the most popular sites. There’s something for everyone here.
* **Gyeongju** has an incredible amount of historic things to see, but also has a nice, laid-back atmosphere. Stay here for at least two full days.
* We only went to **Daegu** because we did a **templestay** at the **Donghwasa** **temple** here, which was fantastic.
* **Suncheon** was the biggest surprise for me. Also a nice relaxed atmosphere, a fairly small city, but still lots of nice things to do. 
* **Busan** is good if you like beaches and big cities. It’s a bit bland though. And getting from point A to B with public transport can take a while.
* **Gwangju** is an all-around big city with a couple of nice things to do, but can be skipped if you have little time.
* **Wonju** is very much off the beaten track, but it does have **Museum San**, which is a must-visit if you’re into modern art and architecture. Can also be done as a day trip from Seoul. 
* **Jeonju** is okay. The Hanok village is a bit of a tourist trap (the one in Gyeongju is much nicer) and besides the palace there’s not that much to see here. Also skip if you’re short on time.

We didn’t visit Jeju island so unfortunately i can’t say anything about it.

# Deep dive

Okay, now for the deep dive. Here’s everything you need to know when visiting South Korea.

# What you’ll need / things to know before you go

* A smartphone with an internet data plan is pretty much **essential**. The public transport is amazing, but if you don’t want to get stuck asking questions all the time (and people speak little to no English) and figuring out complicated bus timetables you’ll need a smartphone. 
* Fortunately data plans are easy to buy using the eSIM system (make sure your phone supports that). We got [the one from KT](https://roaming.kt.com/esim/eng/m/main.asp) which, depending on the number of days you stay here, will set you back around 3.000 won (about €2) per day but is totally worth it. You can just get a ‘data-only’ plan, you won’t need a plan that also supports calling. These plans works by sending you a QR code, **which you should scan a day or so before you leave**. They will start from that moment. Make sure to disable the data/roaming setting for your regular plan to avoid high costs. With modern smartphones you can use both your regular SIM and the eSIM at the same time so you can still receive calls and use apps to need access to your regular SIM.
* Once you get to South Korea you’ll **need** one of the major mapping apps. Google Maps doesn’t give you (walking and transport) directions in Korea, so you need either the **Naver** or **Kakao** app. We preferred the Naver app because it tends to have more English texts and labels (although not everything is translated). Kakao can be useful for things you can’t find on Naver. 
* Also very useful is the **Papago** app which translates better to/from Korean than Google Translate. You can also use it to instantly translate images with text to English, like the menus you’ll find in restaurants. 
* The **k.ride** app is kind of like the Korean Uber. You can attach a credit card and enter your destination, making it a bit easier to communicate. Note that you do pay a percentage for using the app. You can also just hail a cab on the street, which is cheaper. Taxis in generals are quite cheap (5000 won for a small ride) and trustworthy. Note that a **red** sign means the cab is free and **green** means occupied!
* We had little luck using our Dutch debit cards in Korean ATM’s so you’ll also need a **credit card**. In most places you can also pay using a credit card.
* The weather can be quite fluky in april! We brought our winter coats which felt like overkill, but in the end they were very useful during the windy hikes along the Busan beach. Make sure to bring clothes that work in all seasons if you’re also going around this time!
* To get around public transport in all cities you’ll need a **T-money card**. You can get these at most metro stations and the Incheon airport. To charge it, the easiest way is to go to any convenience store (GS25, 7-11, CU) and ask the clerk to charge it while handing over cash. Note that you can’t charge a T-money card with a credit card!
* It’s nice to learn Hangul (the Korean script) and not that hard (because it’s an alphabet, like Latin or Cyrillic) and can sometimes be useful. However, virtually all important signs are also translated in English and there’s always the Papago app.
* In general we found Korea super safe to travel around. Of course you always need to use common sense (make sure to keep your important belongings on you, watch out for pickpockets, etc.). But we were never scammed or had the feeling that we’re paying more because we’re Western tourists. 

# Transport

Transport in Korea is amazing, as long as you have the Naver app, a credit card and a T-money card (see under ‘Essentials’). 

*Intercity busses*  
One of the things that surprised me the most is the fantastic **intercity bus network**. We’ve travelled before by bus from city to city in other countries and usually it’s a cheap, but gruelling affair. Confusing timetables and stops, and a lot of hassle to buy tickets.

Not so in South-Korea. Bus stations usually look more like luxurious malls, with loads of places to get food and drinks. There are surprisingly well-designed (English) touch displays where you can buy a ticket, and even select the seat you want. It’s very clear where the busses leave and they usually leave **exactly on time** and **arrive exactly on time**. It’s almost comical: the first time we took a bus (from Seoul to Jeonju) the bus literally arrived 15 seconds before the scheduled time at the destination. There are many bus lanes in the country, so that also helps in speeding up bus traffic.

The busses are also super comfortable. You get three seats in a row, so lots of leg room and free fast wifi. If you select the ‘premium’ option instead of ‘excellent’ you might even got a touchscreen with movies, like on an airplane. 

There is also a train network which is probably excellent as well, but we never used it because the busses were so cheap and comfortable.

It might be wise to buy tickets in advance if you’re going to popular places and there are not that many busses, or traveling on busy moments (e.g. Friday evenings). You can easily reserve / buy tickets in advance from the touch screens in the bus terminals. There’s usually friendly personnel around if you need help.

*Public transport*  
Public transport in cities is usually very good, as long as you have your T-money card and the Naver app. Most cities have extensive bus networks, and the larger ones also have metro lines. You really need the Naver app to understand the bus system. Most busses will call all stops in English and have a screen that shows the stop name in English as well. To check in, simply touch your T-money card when entering the bus and do that again when leaving the bus.

Note that many seats tend to be reserved for the elderly, disabled and pregnant. Using those seats if you don’t fall in those categories will be frowned upon.

City bus drivers tend to drive quite…sporty. So hold on tight whenever you’re standing or walking down the aisle. 

# Where to stay

Korea has many hotels, guesthouses and dorms. We mostly tried to find smaller hotels and guesthouses. If you don’t speak Korean you’re mostly limited to the regular methods (e.g. [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and AirBnB). Even though we were in cherry blossom season (April) we had little trouble finding accommodation (we only booked the first three nights in advance). It was a bit harder in the weekends, so maybe don’t wait too long with booking your accommodation, especially if there are also public holidays.

Most guesthouses were very clean, comfortable and full of amenities (e.g. a washing machine, a water purifier). One thing that many hotels do lack is a bit of character. IKEA furniture and rooms without any decoration are rampant. You will also encounter many ‘contactless checkins’ where you just get a couple of keycodes and you check yourself in and out. Make sure you have WhatsApp, which tends to be the most common medium of sending you these codes. 

Hotels are pretty cheap compared to most western countries. You can easily find a double in a decent hotel for under 100.000 won (about €60).

# Where to eat and drink

Korea has a crazy amount of restaurants, coffee places and bars. Apparently there’s one coffee house for every 500 inhabitants and one chicken restaurant for every 1500. You’ll have no problem finding good places to eat and drink. Once again, the Naver app is useful here in finding the restaurants of your liking. It also usually has the menu of the restaurant right in the app (or at least a picture of the menu). Naver has a couple of useful filters, including one for restaurants that are friendly for ‘solo diners’. 

We heard from many people that Korea is very meat-centric, which is true but it’s not that hard to find places that focus more on veggies. If you’re a strict vegan or vegetarian it might be difficult, because meat and fish can be used in unexpected places (e.g. the seasoning used in kimchi). 

Some useful things to know when dining:

* Usually you collect your own cutlery. This can be in a hidden drawer in your table, or in a central place in the restaurant.
* Get water at the water cooler for free.
* In the cheaper restaurants you get up and collect your own *banchan* (side dishes).
* Pay at the counter, not at your table. Most places accept credit cards.

In terms of *what* you can eat there’s just *so much* to choose from. Just try something different every night! One way to cheaply try a lot of different dishes at once is going to a ‘buffet restaurant’ (this is also a filter on Naver), which is basically an ‘all-you-can-eat’ restaurant where you can try many different types of food. 

There are places with ‘western food’, but unfortunately they tend to be quite expensive (e.g. double the price of what you pay for Korean food) and usually not that great (finding good pizza is hard). The most common non-Korean food is Chinese and Japanese. Ramen places are everywhere.

Breakfast is not really a thing in Korea. For some reason the Koreans really don’t do ‘European bread’, it’s all quite chewy and sweet to be honest. Don’t be fooled by chains with names like ‘Paris Baguette’, ‘Tous les Jours’ and ‘Oma’s Brötchen’: French and German bakers would cry when they would find out what goes around for bread here. There are some good ‘European-style’ bakers but they are hard to find. We found good bread at a small chain called ‘Butter Bakery’ in Seoul.

One thing the Koreans do very well though is coffee. As mentioned, there’s a coffee place on basically every corner. Most of them conveniently allow you to order from a screen with English translations. Make sure you choose the ‘hot’ option if you don’t want to end up with ice coffee, which is very popular here. There are also an incredible amount of non-coffee drinks like fruit juices, sodas and all kinds of weird contraptions featuring large amounts of sugar, cream and sweet stuff. I think we tried all the major chains and in our humble opinion the best chain is ‘Compose Coffee’, closely followed by ‘Paik’s Coffee’. You usually pay around 4000 won (€2,50) for a big latte. 

# Where to shop

Frankly, we’re not very big on shopping so this section is going to be rather short. Korea doesn’t have many supermarkets, instead you can rely on the **convenience stores** (GS25, 7-11, CU) for small groceries (snacks, drinks, etc.) and of course the many **markets** for bigger things.

One chain store that i would like to recommend is **daiso**. It’s a kind of ‘dollar store’, but with the variety and design aesthetics of something like IKEA or Flying Tiger. If you ever need a smartphone cable, cheap cosmetics or crazy stationary this is the place to go to. I think we bought 90% of all our presents here.

# Places

Ok, on to recommendations for the different places that we visited. I tend to write longer about the things that i liked, and less so about the things that i didn’t like that much. The sights at every city are ordered by how much i would recommend them.

# Seoul

Well, Seoul has it all. First of all, it’s gigantic. The metropolitan area is home to around 25 million people (this includes cities like Incheon and Suwon), about half of all Korean people live in this area. Even though it’s gigantic there are many places that don’t feel like ‘giant city’ at all, and it’s easy to get around using the extensive public transport network. Just realise that it might take some time to get from one part of the city to another.

You’ll need at last three full days to explore a couple of the top spots, but you can very easily stay much longer here. We stayed for nine nights. We had a hotel in the Mangwon-dong area (around the Mapo-gu Office and Mangwon metro stops). I can recommend this area. There are loads of nice restaurants and bars, but it ‘s not as busy and touristy as the area around, for example, Hongik University. It’s still very close to most of the sights and you’re also quite close to Incheon airport. Mangwon market is great for sampling lots of different street food. 

*National Museum of Korea*  
This major free museum should be on the top on your list. It has three floors full of amazing Korean historic artifacts and art, in a spectacular building with an amazing view. There are free English tours. It’s very big so be prepared to either spend a lot of time here, miss a lot or go twice.

*Changgyeonggung Palace & Secret garden*  
This is the one palace you should visit in Seoul. The palace ground are more diverse and interesting compared to many of the other palaces in Korea that we’ve seen. I also highly recommend the Secret Garden tour, it’s very beautiful and we had a super funny tour guide. Note that you need to buy tickets for the Secret Garden separately, and it might be wise to reserve them in advance. The palace grounds (not the garden) are free if you are dressed in *hanbok* (traditional Korean clothes) which you can rent in many shops around the palace.

*DMZ* *daytrip*  
Even though you’re kind of paying to listen to propaganda, a tour to the DMZ is something you should do when visiting Korea. Since 1953 the Korean peninsula has been split up in North and South along a “military demarcation line” (MDL), around the 38th parallel north. Around this MDL there is a so-called ‘demilitarized zone’ (DMZ) 2 kilometers north and south. The daytrips actually don’t take you into the DMZ, but just south of it, in yet another ‘zone’ (the civilian control zone, or CCZ).

Commonly these daytrips include a visit to Imjingang park, with dozens of different monuments. “The third tunnel”, which is one of the four discovered tunnels that North Korea allegedly dug for a hostile invasion. The Dorasan observatory, where you get a close look at North Korea. And “Unification village”, the only inhabited village within the DMZ.

It’s all very strange and weird. Even though you’re in a military environment there are ferris wheels, restaurants and lots of discutable souvenirs (who doesn’t want a DMZ fridge magnet?). It kind of feels like being in a David Lynch movie.

There are a couple of different tour operators. We went with [VIP Travel](https://www.vviptravel.com/), which costs us around 70.000 won. Word is that all the tour operators offer more or less the same, and the ‘extra stops’ like the red suspension bridge aren’t worth it.

*Cheonggyecheon Museum and river*  
This is a remarkable free museum dedicated to Seoul and the Cheonggyecheon stream. Once a vital lifeline for the city, the stream became heavily polluted after the Japanese occupation as people flocked to Seoul in large numbers. Over the decades following the war, it was covered over and transformed into a highway. In a fascinating turn of events, it was restored as a river in the early 2000s.

Beyond the museum, the Cheonggyecheon stream itself is also definitely worth a visit, particularly on pleasant days. You can enjoy a relaxing stroll along its banks, and you’ll even find free spots with books available to read.

*National Museum of Korean Contemporary History*  
Close to the Gyeongbokgung palace, this free museum has a surprisingly good (English) overview of, unsurprisingly, Korean contemporary history.  A good museum to view early on in your trip, so you get a bit of perspective on how the Korean peninsula evolved. 

*Museum Leeum*  
The private art collection from Samsung is displayed in this futuristic and highly photogenic building (note: entrance fee). Both the modern and traditional permanent collections are great, and there are good temporary exhibitions here as well.

*Arario Museum in Space*  
This is a private (hence: not free) modern art museum, very close to Changgyeongung Palace. I liked the curation of this museum, which focuses on sombre and gloomy art. Definitely not for everyone, but if you like dark art, this is the place for you. Very weird building (it used to be an office space) as well. 

*Museum Kimchikan*  
I thought this would be a tourist trap, but the Kimchi Museum is actually quite good! There’s a lot to see here, and you can even taste different kinds of kimchi! I also highly recommend the excellent vegan kimbap (Korean sushi) place at the ground floor (Maru JaYeonSik Kimbap). 

*Gangnam*  
Gangnam is a large neighborhood on the south bank of the Han river, famous because of the rich inhabitants and of course *that* song by PSY. Gangnam has limited ‘big’ sights, but there are a couple of nice things to see. We liked to walk around the **Seonjeongneung** park and look at the royal tombs. There is the inescapable **Gangnam Style Statue** next to the colossal COEX Mall for the obligatory selfie. And next to the mall there’s the meditative **Bongeunsa temple**. 

*Daytrip to Suwon*  
Suwon is a big city (around 1.2 million residents) about 30 km south of Seoul. It makes for a nice daytrip, there are many options to get here. Things you can visit here are the Haewoojae museum, better known as **Mr. toilet house**, dedicated to …well, you know. You can have a nice stroll around the **old fortress walls** and climb the **Paldalsan mountain** for nice views. The **Suwon Museum of Art** was surprisingly good. A bit more to the west of the centre is the giant **Starfield Suwon** mall which hosts the Instagram-famous **Starfield library**.

*Seoul Museum of Art*  
Another free museum, focusing on modern art. I would say it’s worth it alone for the fabulous work by Korean video artist Nam June Paik in the lobby (one of his last before his passing), but if you’re not that much into art you could skip this one.

*The War Memorial of Korea*  
Another giant free museum about Korean military history. Expect lots of school children, tanks and airplanes. It’s okay to get a bit of historical perspective, but for a better explanation i would recommend the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History instead.

*Other sights in brief*  
**Seoullo 7017** is an elevated park, reminiscent but a lot less charming then the New York High Line, but worth a visit if you’re in the neighborhood. If you’re there anyway you could also visit take a look at the futuristic **Seoul City Hall** and the former city hall which is now the **Seoul Metropolitan Library**. There’s a free rooftop garden with nice views.

If you’re a palace lover you will also probably like the **Gyeongbokgung** palace. On the palace grounds you can visit the fine **National Folk Museum of Korea**. 

*Restaurants*  
There are a bazillion restaurants in Seoul and i recommend you find your own favourite spots, but here a couple that we liked:

* [**Oreno Ramen**](https://naver.me/F9N46JvU). Great restaurant with a good rich chicken ramen. Has a Michelin Bib Gourmand. 
* [**Butter Bakery**](https://naver.me/F75X7SXj). The best “European-style” bread that we had in Korea. Great French-style baguettes.
* [**Itaewon Uyuk Mien**](https://naver.me/xktc864D). Best bulgogi we had in Korea.

# Gyeongju

Gyeongju is a truly lovely city. It’s packed with historical sights just waiting to be explored, and despite being quite popular with tourists, it maintains a relaxed atmosphere. Part of this charm comes from the fact that its central area avoids the ubiquitous concrete high-rise apartment buildings found in many other Korean cities.

One thing that is not so convenient about Gyeongju is the **public transport system**. There are busses to all the major tourists sites, but for some reason they tend to run really infrequently (like once every 60-90 minutes or so) and are hard to comprehend, even with the Naver app. Be prepared to wait for a while, get a cab, or rent your own transportation. 

Some of the most popular sites are the numerous **burial mounds** right in the center of the city, the **Bulguksa** temple up in the mountains and the **Donggung Palace**. 

*Teddybear and rabbit museum*  
This is a pretty weird place that has a giant collection of teddybears and other stuffed animals that are put into ridiculous scenes. Expect quirky photo opportunities with teddybears battling dinosaurs in ancient Korea.

*Namsan mountain*  
There are many walks around this holy mountain, where you can visit countless temples and ancient Buddha statues. A good starting spot for a hike is the Samneung Information Center. I would probably recommend this over the Bulguksa temple if you’re short on time. Bring proper hiking gear. 

*Gyeongju National Museum*  
A large free museum explaining the Silla empire with many artifacts from the burial mounds that are aplenty in the city. Excellent free English tours on Sundays.

*Seongdong market*  
This is a giant traditional market in the centre. I highly recommend the excellent buffet stalls where you can eat as much as you like for around 9000 won. A bit hard to find, but definitely worth the effort!

# Daegu

We only went to Daegu to get a bus to the fabolous [**Donghwasa temple**](https://www.templestay.com/en/MI000000000000000062/reserve/view.do?pageIndex=1&areaCd=&templestaySeq=25342&templeBookMarkId=Donghwasa&templeIdTmp=&areaSelect=&templeId=&templePrgType=&searchCnt=&searchStaDate=&searchEndDate=&searchKeyword=donghwasa) up in the mountains to do a one-night **templestay** here, which was amazing. There are templestays all around South-Korea, which can easily be found and booked [at the English website](https://www.templestay.com/en/main/view.do). I think most of them are quite comparable, but in our case we got a simple room with private bathroom. We participated in many of the rituals with the monks, including evening prayer and eating in the communal canteen. One of the highlights was ‘tea time’ with one of the monks, who spoke excellent English. Highy recommended.

# Suncheon

Suncheon was the biggest surprise to me. It’s not on many ‘must-see’ itineraries of South Korea, but it should! It has the same laid-back atmosphere that you also get in Gyeongju, but without all the tourists. Arguably it doesn’t have the same amount of sights that Gyeongju has, but there is enough to see here for at least a full day, and you can easily spend two full days here.

*Suncheon National Gardens*  
The national gardens are the main attraction of the city. Originally opened in 2013, it’s kind of a weird cross between a botanical garden and a theme park. There are lots of cultivated gardens here, but there are also attractions, a pet zoo and a crazy ‘space bridge’. There’s a ‘Sky Cube’, an elevated railway that takes you to the ‘Wetlands’ area in the south of the city. The wetlands are honestly not *that* interesting, but the train ride is kind of fun. 

*Open Set*  
Also known as the Drama Set or Movie Set, this is a large fake city used as a set in many Korean movies. There’s a complete historical town here, but also a more contemporary ‘Korean town’ from the seventies. Lots of silly attraction as well, there’s even a free karaoke booth. 

*Honam Patriots Memorial Hall*  
Surprisingly good museum about the different wars the Koreans fought in. And not that gigantic as the War Memorial in Seoul. Also cool because they have a room with about 20(!) VR helmets and shaking seats that they love to use on foreign tourists.

# Busan

Busan is a giant city, the second largest in Korea after Seoul. It’s stretched out along the southeastern coast. This also means that transport **takes a while**. Taking a bus from one side of the city to the other can easily take 90 minutes or more. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in public transport here. Compared to Seoul i think Busan it’s just a bit…bland. Seoul is more dense and layered, making it more vibrant in my opinion. Still, if you like beaches, coast and nightlife you’ll probably love Busan.

The **Museum of Contemporary Art** was a bit too highbrow for my taste (it’s also pretty far out of the centre). It’s nice to take a stroll in **Gamcheon village**, but it’s also very touristy. The **National Science Museum** is okay, little information in English here although the exhibits look spectacular. 

*Haedong Yonggungsa*  
Even though this temple is *very* touristy, it’s definitely worth it. This temple is built on a spectacular site, on the cliffs next to the sea. We were there on a grey rainy day, and even then it was amazing. 

*Igidae Coastal Trail*  
You can make a beautiful hike here along the coast line. The route is very accessible, lots of well-designed steps and bridges and stunning views. Highly recommended.

*UN Memorial Cemetery*  
Pretty close to the coastal trail is this cemetery for UN soldiers who died during the Korea war (1950 – 1953). It’s a meditative and respectful experience which i can highly recommend as well.

# Gwangju

Gwangju is your typical ‘big-but-its-not-seoul-or-busan’ Korean city. The city itself is not very inspiring, but it has a couple of nice sights that could fill a day or two. If you’re short on time i would skip Gwangju.

*Museums*  
There is a cluster of three large museums in the northwestern corner of the city: the **National Gwangju Museum,** the **Gwangju Art Museum** and the **Gwangju Folk Museum**. Honestly i can’t remember much from them so they’re probably not that amazing. The **National Museum** had a couple of interesting items (although you’ll probably see similar items in the **National Museum of Korea** in Seoul). The **Folk Museum** had a robot that can be your tour guide, which was kind of fun.

*Penguin Village*  
This is a small neighbourhood around the Yangnimgyo bridge in the southeast part of town. It’s quite pleasant to have a little stroll there and admire the mural art and check out the small shops and bars.

*Mudeungsan National Park*  
A park that’s easy to reach by public transport and where you can do many different hikes. I would recommend taking the **1187** **bus** and get out at Mudeungsan National Park / Wonhyosa temple.

# Jeonju

Jeonju was okay in my opinion. Definitely skippable if you’re short on time. The historical **Hanok village** mostly consists of restaurants, guesthouses and snack joints, it doesn’t feel very ‘historical’ to be honest. For some reason we visited **Deokjin park**, which you can certainly skip. 

*Gyeonggijeon shrine and Royal Portrait Museum*  
Right next to the Hanok village and worth the effort. Especially the portrait museum has interesting exhibitions and has a couple of really fun things to do for children.

*Jeonju National Museum*  
Excellent museum, with lots of information signposted in English. Next doors History Museum is a bit rundown and shows it age, but it’s free so you can have a look if you’re there anyway.

# Wonju

Let’s be frank: Wonju is not on any Korean itinerary. The main reason we visited this place is because we wanted to visit **Museum SAN**, which is kind of a must-visit if you’re into modern art and architecture. Still, Wonju was surprisingly nice and i can easily recommend this place as a stopover for a night if you’re traveling from Gyeongju to Seoul. Wonju and Museum SAN can also be done as a daytrip from Seoul. 

This section is a bit more verbose and specific because there’s a lack of good tourist information about Wonju in English.

*Wonju City Tour Bus*  
An excellent way to see Wonju is by using the [**Wonju City Tour Bus**](https://www.wonju.go.kr/english/contents.do?key=4636&). This is a hop-on hop-off bus that stops at the major sights, like Museum SAN and the suspension bridge area. For 5000 won (\~€3) you’ll get a wristband that allows you unlimited travel on the bus and 20% discounts on all the sights. The bus doesn’t run very often (about once every hour per stop) so you need to time it a bit, but it’s the best way to get to the sights if you don’t have your own car, and a lot cheaper than getting cabs. 

Every stop has a scheduled timetable, so you can time your stops very well. You’ll also get a free lecture when you’re in the bus which unfortunately will be in Korean. Also note that the tour bus doesn’t run on Mondays (when Museum SAN is closed anyway). There are multiple stops in the city, including one at the bus terminal and the train station. 

[*Museum SAN*](https://www.museumsan.org/eng/guidance/view_guide.jsp?m=5&s=1)  
So, the main reason we visited Wonju is this museum. It opened in 2013 and is designed by the famous Japanese architect Tadao Ando. Just the building itself is worth the visit, it’s set on a pretty dramatic mountain top and has spectacular views from within the building. One of the main attractions is a collection of four light works by the American artist James Turrell. There is also a permanent exhibition about Korean paper, a meditation hall and multiple sculpture gardens.

Entrance is a bit expensive. You’ll pay at least 23.000 won (€14) for the ‘basic ticket’, 39.000 (€24) if you also want to see James Turrell and 46.000 (€28) for everything. Remember though that you’ll get a 20% discount if you’ve got the city tour bus bracelet. The museum cafetaria is also very expensive (around 10.000 won for a simple coffee) so bring your own lunch or eat somewhere else if you want to save money.

[*Sogeumsan Suspension Bridge*](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/whereToGo/locIntrdn/rgnContentsView.do?vcontsId=64457)  
This is another main sight of Wonju (and stop on the bus tour). It’s the largest pedestrian suspension bridge in Korea, with a length of 200 meters. We didn’t have enough time to see the bridge, but the area around it is also very nice, with lots of small shops and restaurants around the river. There’s also an impressive looking cable car you can take towards the bridge.

Another ‘attraction’ in the same area is an [abandoned railway station](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%84%ED%98%84%EC%97%AD). It apparently was in use as a tourist attraction where you can cycle up and down the abandoned train tracks using special carts, but that attraction has, sadly, been abandoned as well.

*Other things in Wonju*  
There is the free Wonju history museum which i guess might be interesting if you can read Korean (there was very little signage in English). There is a nice museum garden, which includes a replica of the childhood home of former president Choi Kyu-hah, who was born in Wonju.

There’s a pleasant park around the river in the centre of the city, around the 치악교 bridge.

I can also recommend to stroll around the Wonju Jungang market for a bit.

\-----

That’s all folks! Congratulations if you read this post all through the end. [I've also posted everything on my blog](https://www.haykranen.nl/2025/05/15/everything-you-need-to-know-when-visiting-south-korea/), accompanied by a couple of pictures from our visit.",95,Trip Report,Wow. Thank you so much. Incredible trip report with such attention to details. Much appreciated. 🫡 | Very nice write up. | Thank you for this very detailed and helpful post. I saved it for my trip later this year | Going to Korea on the last week of May and this is incredibly helpful! Thanks a bunch! | As someone who on her last day of trip in Korea I couldn’t write this better. I’m going to put a link to yours on the post that I’m going to write but mine is focus on shopping and beauty hahahaha!,"My far too long ""everything you need to know when visiting South Korea"" trip report I recently had the opportunity to spend four weeks on holiday in South Korea with my wife. We loved it. And what’s better than to share that love with everyone here? Here is everything i learned from visiting the land of the morning calm, and what you should know as well.

# Context

My wife and I (we’re both in our fourties) traveled around South Korea around April 2025. I mostly limit my tips to ‘things to do and see’, because restaurants and hotels change so quickly. You can read more about how we found lodging and restaurants later in this post.

# TL;DR

All of these points will be elaborated in more detail later on in this post.

*Essentials*

* Bring a **creditcard**.
* Install the **Naver** app.
* Get an eSim with a **dataplan**.
* Get the **T-money card**.

*Itinerary*  
We had four weeks and could have seen much more, there’s just so much to see and explore! These are the cities we visited in the order of recommendation.

* You’ll probably fly in and out of **Seoul**. Seoul is gigantic, and you’ll need at least three full days to see a selection of the most popular sites. There’s something for everyone here.
* **Gyeongju** has an incredible amount of historic things to see, but also has a nice, laid-back atmosphere. Stay here for at least two full days.
* We only went to **Daegu** because we did a **templestay** at the **Donghwasa** **temple** here, which was fantastic.
* **Suncheon** was the biggest surprise for me. Also a nice relaxed atmosphere, a fairly small city, but still lots of nice things to do. 
* **Busan** is good if you like beaches and big cities. It’s a bit bland though. And getting from point A to B with public transport can take a while.
* **Gwangju** is an all-around big city with a couple of nice things to do, but can be skipped if you have little time.
* **Wonju** is very much off the beaten track, but it does have **Museum San**, which is a must-visit if you’re into modern art and architecture. Can also be done as a day trip from Seoul. 
* **Jeonju** is okay. The Hanok village is a bit of a tourist trap (the one in Gyeongju is much nicer) and besides the palace there’s not that much to see here. Also skip if you’re short on time.

We didn’t visit Jeju island so unfortunately i can’t say anything about it.

# Deep dive

Okay, now for the deep dive. Here’s everything you need to know when visiting South Korea.

# What you’ll need / things to know before you go

* A smartphone with an internet data plan is pretty much **essential**. The public transport is amazing, but if you don’t want to get stuck asking questions all the time (and people speak little to no English) and figuring out complicated bus timetables you’ll need a smartphone. 
* Fortunately data plans are easy to buy using the eSIM system (make sure your phone supports that). We got [the one from KT](https://roaming.kt.com/esim/eng/m/main.asp) which, depending on the number of days you stay here, will set you back around 3.000 won (about €2) per day but is totally worth it. You can just get a ‘data-only’ plan, you won’t need a plan that also supports calling. These plans works by sending you a QR code, **which you should scan a day or so before you leave**. They will start from that moment. Make sure to disable the data/roaming setting for your regular plan to avoid high costs. With modern smartphones you can use both your regular SIM and the eSIM at the same time so you can still receive calls and use apps to need access to your regular SIM.
* Once you get to South Korea you’ll **need** one of the major mapping apps. Google Maps doesn’t give you (walking and transport) directions in Korea, so you need either the **Naver** or **Kakao** app. We preferred the Naver app because it tends to have more English texts and labels (although not everything is translated). Kakao can be useful for things you can’t find on Naver. 
* Also very useful is the **Papago** app which translates better to/from Korean than Google Translate. You can also use it to instantly translate images with text to English, like the menus you’ll find in restaurants. 
* The **k.ride** app is kind of like the Korean Uber. You can attach a credit card and enter your destination, making it a bit easier to communicate. Note that you do pay a percentage for using the app. You can also just hail a cab on the street, which is cheaper. Taxis in generals are quite cheap (5000 won for a small ride) and trustworthy. Note that a **red** sign means the cab is free and **green** means occupied!
* We had little luck using our Dutch debit cards in Korean ATM’s so you’ll also need a **credit card**. In most places you can also pay using a credit card.
* The weather can be quite fluky in april! We brought our winter coats which felt like overkill, but in the end they were very useful during the windy hikes along the Busan beach. Make sure to bring clothes that work in all seasons if you’re also going around this time!
* To get around public transport in all cities you’ll need a **T-money card**. You can get these at most metro stations and the Incheon airport. To charge it, the easiest way is to go to any convenience store (GS25, 7-11, CU) and ask the clerk to charge it while handing over cash. Note that you can’t charge a T-money card with a credit card!
* It’s nice to learn Hangul (the Korean script) and not that hard (because it’s an alphabet, like Latin or Cyrillic) and can sometimes be useful. However, virtually all important signs are also translated in English and there’s always the Papago app.
* In general we found Korea super safe to travel around. Of course you always need to use common sense (make sure to keep your important belongings on you, watch out for pickpockets, etc.). But we were never scammed or had the feeling that we’re paying more because we’re Western tourists. 

# Transport

Transport in Korea is amazing, as long as you have the Naver app, a credit card and a T-money card (see under ‘Essentials’). 

*Intercity busses*  
One of the things that surprised me the most is the fantastic **intercity bus network**. We’ve travelled before by bus from city to city in other countries and usually it’s a cheap, but gruelling affair. Confusing timetables and stops, and a lot of hassle to buy tickets.

Not so in South-Korea. Bus stations usually look more like luxurious malls, with loads of places to get food and drinks. There are surprisingly well-designed (English) touch displays where you can buy a ticket, and even select the seat you want. It’s very clear where the busses leave and they usually leave **exactly on time** and **arrive exactly on time**. It’s almost comical: the first time we took a bus (from Seoul to Jeonju) the bus literally arrived 15 seconds before the scheduled time at the destination. There are many bus lanes in the country, so that also helps in speeding up bus traffic.

The busses are also super comfortable. You get three seats in a row, so lots of leg room and free fast wifi. If you select the ‘premium’ option instead of ‘excellent’ you might even got a touchscreen with movies, like on an airplane. 

There is also a train network which is probably excellent as well, but we never used it because the busses were so cheap and comfortable.

It might be wise to buy tickets in advance if you’re going to popular places and there are not that many busses, or traveling on busy moments (e.g. Friday evenings). You can easily reserve / buy tickets in advance from the touch screens in the bus terminals. There’s usually friendly personnel around if you need help.

*Public transport*  
Public transport in cities is usually very good, as long as you have your T-money card and the Naver app. Most cities have extensive bus networks, and the larger ones also have metro lines. You really need the Naver app to understand the bus system. Most busses will call all stops in English and have a screen that shows the stop name in English as well. To check in, simply touch your T-money card when entering the bus and do that again when leaving the bus.

Note that many seats tend to be reserved for the elderly, disabled and pregnant. Using those seats if you don’t fall in those categories will be frowned upon.

City bus drivers tend to drive quite…sporty. So hold on tight whenever you’re standing or walking down the aisle. 

# Where to stay

Korea has many hotels, guesthouses and dorms. We mostly tried to find smaller hotels and guesthouses. If you don’t speak Korean you’re mostly limited to the regular methods (e.g. [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and AirBnB). Even though we were in cherry blossom season (April) we had little trouble finding accommodation (we only booked the first three nights in advance). It was a bit harder in the weekends, so maybe don’t wait too long with booking your accommodation, especially if there are also public holidays.

Most guesthouses were very clean, comfortable and full of amenities (e.g. a washing machine, a water purifier). One thing that many hotels do lack is a bit of character. IKEA furniture and rooms without any decoration are rampant. You will also encounter many ‘contactless checkins’ where you just get a couple of keycodes and you check yourself in and out. Make sure you have WhatsApp, which tends to be the most common medium of sending you these codes. 

Hotels are pretty cheap compared to most western countries. You can easily find a double in a decent hotel for under 100.000 won (about €60).

# Where to eat and drink

Korea has a crazy amount of restaurants, coffee places and bars. Apparently there’s one coffee house for every 500 inhabitants and one chicken restaurant for every 1500. You’ll have no problem finding good places to eat and drink. Once again, the Naver app is useful here in finding the restaurants of your liking. It also usually has the menu of the restaurant right in the app (or at least a picture of the menu). Naver has a couple of useful filters, including one for restaurants that are friendly for ‘solo diners’. 

We heard from many people that Korea is very meat-centric, which is true but it’s not that hard to find places that focus more on veggies. If you’re a strict vegan or vegetarian it might be difficult, because meat and fish can be used in unexpected places (e.g. the seasoning used in kimchi). 

Some useful things to know when dining:

* Usually you collect your own cutlery. This can be in a hidden drawer in your table, or in a central place in the restaurant.
* Get water at the water cooler for free.
* In the cheaper restaurants you get up and collect your own *banchan* (side dishes).
* Pay at the counter, not at your table. Most places accept credit cards.

In terms of *what* you can eat there’s just *so much* to choose from. Just try something different every night! One way to cheaply try a lot of different dishes at once is going to a ‘buffet restaurant’ (this is also a filter on Naver), which is basically an ‘all-you-can-eat’ restaurant where you can try many different types of food. 

There are places with ‘western food’, but unfortunately they tend to be quite expensive (e.g. double the price of what you pay for Korean food) and usually not that great (finding good pizza is hard). The most common non-Korean food is Chinese and Japanese. Ramen places are everywhere.

Breakfast is not really a thing in Korea. For some reason the Koreans really don’t do ‘European bread’, it’s all quite chewy and sweet to be honest. Don’t be fooled by chains with names like ‘Paris Baguette’, ‘Tous les Jours’ and ‘Oma’s Brötchen’: French and German bakers would cry when they would find out what goes around for bread here. There are some good ‘European-style’ bakers but they are hard to find. We found good bread at a small chain called ‘Butter Bakery’ in Seoul.

One thing the Koreans do very well though is coffee. As mentioned, there’s a coffee place on basically every corner. Most of them conveniently allow you to order from a screen with English translations. Make sure you choose the ‘hot’ option if you don’t want to end up with ice coffee, which is very popular here. There are also an incredible amount of non-coffee drinks like fruit juices, sodas and all kinds of weird contraptions featuring large amounts of sugar, cream and sweet stuff. I think we tried all the major chains and in our humble opinion the best chain is ‘Compose Coffee’, closely followed by ‘Paik’s Coffee’. You usually pay around 4000 won (€2,50) for a big latte. 

# Where to shop

Frankly, we’re not very big on shopping so this section is going to be rather short. Korea doesn’t have many supermarkets, instead you can rely on the **convenience stores** (GS25, 7-11, CU) for small groceries (snacks, drinks, etc.) and of course the many **markets** for bigger things.

One chain store that i would like to recommend is **daiso**. It’s a kind of ‘dollar store’, but with the variety and design aesthetics of something like IKEA or Flying Tiger. If you ever need a smartphone cable, cheap cosmetics or crazy stationary this is the place to go to. I think we bought 90% of all our presents here.

# Places

Ok, on to recommendations for the different places that we visited. I tend to write longer about the things that i liked, and less so about the things that i didn’t like that much. The sights at every city are ordered by how much i would recommend them.

# Seoul

Well, Seoul has it all. First of all, it’s gigantic. The metropolitan area is home to around 25 million people (this includes cities like Incheon and Suwon), about half of all Korean people live in this area. Even though it’s gigantic there are many places that don’t feel like ‘giant city’ at all, and it’s easy to get around using the extensive public transport network. Just realise that it might take some time to get from one part of the city to another.

You’ll need at last three full days to explore a couple of the top spots, but you can very easily stay much longer here. We stayed for nine nights. We had a hotel in the Mangwon-dong area (around the Mapo-gu Office and Mangwon metro stops). I can recommend this area. There are loads of nice restaurants and bars, but it ‘s not as busy and touristy as the area around, for example, Hongik University. It’s still very close to most of the sights and you’re also quite close to Incheon airport. Mangwon market is great for sampling lots of different street food. 

*National Museum of Korea*  
This major free museum should be on the top on your list. It has three floors full of amazing Korean historic artifacts and art, in a spectacular building with an amazing view. There are free English tours. It’s very big so be prepared to either spend a lot of time here, miss a lot or go twice.

*Changgyeonggung Palace & Secret garden*  
This is the one palace you should visit in Seoul. The palace ground are more diverse and interesting compared to many of the other palaces in Korea that we’ve seen. I also highly recommend the Secret Garden tour, it’s very beautiful and we had a super funny tour guide. Note that you need to buy tickets for the Secret Garden separately, and it might be wise to reserve them in advance. The palace grounds (not the garden) are free if you are dressed in *hanbok* (traditional Korean clothes) which you can rent in many shops around the palace.

*DMZ* *daytrip*  
Even though you’re kind of paying to listen to propaganda, a tour to the DMZ is something you should do when visiting Korea. Since 1953 the Korean peninsula has been split up in North and South along a “military demarcation line” (MDL), around the 38th parallel north. Around this MDL there is a so-called ‘demilitarized zone’ (DMZ) 2 kilometers north and south. The daytrips actually don’t take you into the DMZ, but just south of it, in yet another ‘zone’ (the civilian control zone, or CCZ).

Commonly these daytrips include a visit to Imjingang park, with dozens of different monuments. “The third tunnel”, which is one of the four discovered tunnels that North Korea allegedly dug for a hostile invasion. The Dorasan observatory, where you get a close look at North Korea. And “Unification village”, the only inhabited village within the DMZ.

It’s all very strange and weird. Even though you’re in a military environment there are ferris wheels, restaurants and lots of discutable souvenirs (who doesn’t want a DMZ fridge magnet?). It kind of feels like being in a David Lynch movie.

There are a couple of different tour operators. We went with [VIP Travel](https://www.vviptravel.com/), which costs us around 70.000 won. Word is that all the tour operators offer more or less the same, and the ‘extra stops’ like the red suspension bridge aren’t worth it.

*Cheonggyecheon Museum and river*  
This is a remarkable free museum dedicated to Seoul and the Cheonggyecheon stream. Once a vital lifeline for the city, the stream became heavily polluted after the Japanese occupation as people flocked to Seoul in large numbers. Over the decades following the war, it was covered over and transformed into a highway. In a fascinating turn of events, it was restored as a river in the early 2000s.

Beyond the museum, the Cheonggyecheon stream itself is also definitely worth a visit, particularly on pleasant days. You can enjoy a relaxing stroll along its banks, and you’ll even find free spots with books available to read.

*National Museum of Korean Contemporary History*  
Close to the Gyeongbokgung palace, this free museum has a surprisingly good (English) overview of, unsurprisingly, Korean contemporary history.  A good museum to view early on in your trip, so you get a bit of perspective on how the Korean peninsula evolved. 

*Museum Leeum*  
The private art collection from Samsung is displayed in this futuristic and highly photogenic building (note: entrance fee). Both the modern and traditional permanent collections are great, and there are good temporary exhibitions here as well.

*Arario Museum in Space*  
This is a private (hence: not free) modern art museum, very close to Changgyeongung Palace. I liked the curation of this museum, which focuses on sombre and gloomy art. Definitely not for everyone, but if you like dark art, this is the place for you. Very weird building (it used to be an office space) as well. 

*Museum Kimchikan*  
I thought this would be a tourist trap, but the Kimchi Museum is actually quite good! There’s a lot to see here, and you can even taste different kinds of kimchi! I also highly recommend the excellent vegan kimbap (Korean sushi) place at the ground floor (Maru JaYeonSik Kimbap). 

*Gangnam*  
Gangnam is a large neighborhood on the south bank of the Han river, famous because of the rich inhabitants and of course *that* song by PSY. Gangnam has limited ‘big’ sights, but there are a couple of nice things to see. We liked to walk around the **Seonjeongneung** park and look at the royal tombs. There is the inescapable **Gangnam Style Statue** next to the colossal COEX Mall for the obligatory selfie. And next to the mall there’s the meditative **Bongeunsa temple**. 

*Daytrip to Suwon*  
Suwon is a big city (around 1.2 million residents) about 30 km south of Seoul. It makes for a nice daytrip, there are many options to get here. Things you can visit here are the Haewoojae museum, better known as **Mr. toilet house**, dedicated to …well, you know. You can have a nice stroll around the **old fortress walls** and climb the **Paldalsan mountain** for nice views. The **Suwon Museum of Art** was surprisingly good. A bit more to the west of the centre is the giant **Starfield Suwon** mall which hosts the Instagram-famous **Starfield library**.

*Seoul Museum of Art*  
Another free museum, focusing on modern art. I would say it’s worth it alone for the fabulous work by Korean video artist Nam June Paik in the lobby (one of his last before his passing), but if you’re not that much into art you could skip this one.

*The War Memorial of Korea*  
Another giant free museum about Korean military history. Expect lots of school children, tanks and airplanes. It’s okay to get a bit of historical perspective, but for a better explanation i would recommend the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History instead.

*Other sights in brief*  
**Seoullo 7017** is an elevated park, reminiscent but a lot less charming then the New York High Line, but worth a visit if you’re in the neighborhood. If you’re there anyway you could also visit take a look at the futuristic **Seoul City Hall** and the former city hall which is now the **Seoul Metropolitan Library**. There’s a free rooftop garden with nice views.

If you’re a palace lover you will also probably like the **Gyeongbokgung** palace. On the palace grounds you can visit the fine **National Folk Museum of Korea**. 

*Restaurants*  
There are a bazillion restaurants in Seoul and i recommend you find your own favourite spots, but here a couple that we liked:

* [**Oreno Ramen**](https://naver.me/F9N46JvU). Great restaurant with a good rich chicken ramen. Has a Michelin Bib Gourmand. 
* [**Butter Bakery**](https://naver.me/F75X7SXj). The best “European-style” bread that we had in Korea. Great French-style baguettes.
* [**Itaewon Uyuk Mien**](https://naver.me/xktc864D). Best bulgogi we had in Korea.

# Gyeongju

Gyeongju is a truly lovely city. It’s packed with historical sights just waiting to be explored, and despite being quite popular with tourists, it maintains a relaxed atmosphere. Part of this charm comes from the fact that its central area avoids the ubiquitous concrete high-rise apartment buildings found in many other Korean cities.

One thing that is not so convenient about Gyeongju is the **public transport system**. There are busses to all the major tourists sites, but for some reason they tend to run really infrequently (like once every 60-90 minutes or so) and are hard to comprehend, even with the Naver app. Be prepared to wait for a while, get a cab, or rent your own transportation. 

Some of the most popular sites are the numerous **burial mounds** right in the center of the city, the **Bulguksa** temple up in the mountains and the **Donggung Palace**. 

*Teddybear and rabbit museum*  
This is a pretty weird place that has a giant collection of teddybears and other stuffed animals that are put into ridiculous scenes. Expect quirky photo opportunities with teddybears battling dinosaurs in ancient Korea.

*Namsan mountain*  
There are many walks around this holy mountain, where you can visit countless temples and ancient Buddha statues. A good starting spot for a hike is the Samneung Information Center. I would probably recommend this over the Bulguksa temple if you’re short on time. Bring proper hiking gear. 

*Gyeongju National Museum*  
A large free museum explaining the Silla empire with many artifacts from the burial mounds that are aplenty in the city. Excellent free English tours on Sundays.

*Seongdong market*  
This is a giant traditional market in the centre. I highly recommend the excellent buffet stalls where you can eat as much as you like for around 9000 won. A bit hard to find, but definitely worth the effort!

# Daegu

We only went to Daegu to get a bus to the fabolous [**Donghwasa temple**](https://www.templestay.com/en/MI000000000000000062/reserve/view.do?pageIndex=1&areaCd=&templestaySeq=25342&templeBookMarkId=Donghwasa&templeIdTmp=&areaSelect=&templeId=&templePrgType=&searchCnt=&searchStaDate=&searchEndDate=&searchKeyword=donghwasa) up in the mountains to do a one-night **templestay** here, which was amazing. There are templestays all around South-Korea, which can easily be found and booked [at the English website](https://www.templestay.com/en/main/view.do). I think most of them are quite comparable, but in our case we got a simple room with private bathroom. We participated in many of the rituals with the monks, including evening prayer and eating in the communal canteen. One of the highlights was ‘tea time’ with one of the monks, who spoke excellent English. Highy recommended.

# Suncheon

Suncheon was the biggest surprise to me. It’s not on many ‘must-see’ itineraries of South Korea, but it should! It has the same laid-back atmosphere that you also get in Gyeongju, but without all the tourists. Arguably it doesn’t have the same amount of sights that Gyeongju has, but there is enough to see here for at least a full day, and you can easily spend two full days here.

*Suncheon National Gardens*  
The national gardens are the main attraction of the city. Originally opened in 2013, it’s kind of a weird cross between a botanical garden and a theme park. There are lots of cultivated gardens here, but there are also attractions, a pet zoo and a crazy ‘space bridge’. There’s a ‘Sky Cube’, an elevated railway that takes you to the ‘Wetlands’ area in the south of the city. The wetlands are honestly not *that* interesting, but the train ride is kind of fun. 

*Open Set*  
Also known as the Drama Set or Movie Set, this is a large fake city used as a set in many Korean movies. There’s a complete historical town here, but also a more contemporary ‘Korean town’ from the seventies. Lots of silly attraction as well, there’s even a free karaoke booth. 

*Honam Patriots Memorial Hall*  
Surprisingly good museum about the different wars the Koreans fought in. And not that gigantic as the War Memorial in Seoul. Also cool because they have a room with about 20(!) VR helmets and shaking seats that they love to use on foreign tourists.

# Busan

Busan is a giant city, the second largest in Korea after Seoul. It’s stretched out along the southeastern coast. This also means that transport **takes a while**. Taking a bus from one side of the city to the other can easily take 90 minutes or more. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in public transport here. Compared to Seoul i think Busan it’s just a bit…bland. Seoul is more dense and layered, making it more vibrant in my opinion. Still, if you like beaches, coast and nightlife you’ll probably love Busan.

The **Museum of Contemporary Art** was a bit too highbrow for my taste (it’s also pretty far out of the centre). It’s nice to take a stroll in **Gamcheon village**, but it’s also very touristy. The **National Science Museum** is okay, little information in English here although the exhibits look spectacular. 

*Haedong Yonggungsa*  
Even though this temple is *very* touristy, it’s definitely worth it. This temple is built on a spectacular site, on the cliffs next to the sea. We were there on a grey rainy day, and even then it was amazing. 

*Igidae Coastal Trail*  
You can make a beautiful hike here along the coast line. The route is very accessible, lots of well-designed steps and bridges and stunning views. Highly recommended.

*UN Memorial Cemetery*  
Pretty close to the coastal trail is this cemetery for UN soldiers who died during the Korea war (1950 – 1953). It’s a meditative and respectful experience which i can highly recommend as well.

# Gwangju

Gwangju is your typical ‘big-but-its-not-seoul-or-busan’ Korean city. The city itself is not very inspiring, but it has a couple of nice sights that could fill a day or two. If you’re short on time i would skip Gwangju.

*Museums*  
There is a cluster of three large museums in the northwestern corner of the city: the **National Gwangju Museum,** the **Gwangju Art Museum** and the **Gwangju Folk Museum**. Honestly i can’t remember much from them so they’re probably not that amazing. The **National Museum** had a couple of interesting items (although you’ll probably see similar items in the **National Museum of Korea** in Seoul). The **Folk Museum** had a robot that can be your tour guide, which was kind of fun.

*Penguin Village*  
This is a small neighbourhood around the Yangnimgyo bridge in the southeast part of town. It’s quite pleasant to have a little stroll there and admire the mural art and check out the small shops and bars.

*Mudeungsan National Park*  
A park that’s easy to reach by public transport and where you can do many different hikes. I would recommend taking the **1187** **bus** and get out at Mudeungsan National Park / Wonhyosa temple.

# Jeonju

Jeonju was okay in my opinion. Definitely skippable if you’re short on time. The historical **Hanok village** mostly consists of restaurants, guesthouses and snack joints, it doesn’t feel very ‘historical’ to be honest. For some reason we visited **Deokjin park**, which you can certainly skip. 

*Gyeonggijeon shrine and Royal Portrait Museum*  
Right next to the Hanok village and worth the effort. Especially the portrait museum has interesting exhibitions and has a couple of really fun things to do for children.

*Jeonju National Museum*  
Excellent museum, with lots of information signposted in English. Next doors History Museum is a bit rundown and shows it age, but it’s free so you can have a look if you’re there anyway.

# Wonju

Let’s be frank: Wonju is not on any Korean itinerary. The main reason we visited this place is because we wanted to visit **Museum SAN**, which is kind of a must-visit if you’re into modern art and architecture. Still, Wonju was surprisingly nice and i can easily recommend this place as a stopover for a night if you’re traveling from Gyeongju to Seoul. Wonju and Museum SAN can also be done as a daytrip from Seoul. 

This section is a bit more verbose and specific because there’s a lack of good tourist information about Wonju in English.

*Wonju City Tour Bus*  
An excellent way to see Wonju is by using the [**Wonju City Tour Bus**](https://www.wonju.go.kr/english/contents.do?key=4636&). This is a hop-on hop-off bus that stops at the major sights, like Museum SAN and the suspension bridge area. For 5000 won (\~€3) you’ll get a wristband that allows you unlimited travel on the bus and 20% discounts on all the sights. The bus doesn’t run very often (about once every hour per stop) so you need to time it a bit, but it’s the best way to get to the sights if you don’t have your own car, and a lot cheaper than getting cabs. 

Every stop has a scheduled timetable, so you can time your stops very well. You’ll also get a free lecture when you’re in the bus which unfortunately will be in Korean. Also note that the tour bus doesn’t run on Mondays (when Museum SAN is closed anyway). There are multiple stops in the city, including one at the bus terminal and the train station. 

[*Museum SAN*](https://www.museumsan.org/eng/guidance/view_guide.jsp?m=5&s=1)  
So, the main reason we visited Wonju is this museum. It opened in 2013 and is designed by the famous Japanese architect Tadao Ando. Just the building itself is worth the visit, it’s set on a pretty dramatic mountain top and has spectacular views from within the building. One of the main attractions is a collection of four light works by the American artist James Turrell. There is also a permanent exhibition about Korean paper, a meditation hall and multiple sculpture gardens.

Entrance is a bit expensive. You’ll pay at least 23.000 won (€14) for the ‘basic ticket’, 39.000 (€24) if you also want to see James Turrell and 46.000 (€28) for everything. Remember though that you’ll get a 20% discount if you’ve got the city tour bus bracelet. The museum cafetaria is also very expensive (around 10.000 won for a simple coffee) so bring your own lunch or eat somewhere else if you want to save money.

[*Sogeumsan Suspension Bridge*](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/whereToGo/locIntrdn/rgnContentsView.do?vcontsId=64457)  
This is another main sight of Wonju (and stop on the bus tour). It’s the largest pedestrian suspension bridge in Korea, with a length of 200 meters. We didn’t have enough time to see the bridge, but the area around it is also very nice, with lots of small shops and restaurants around the river. There’s also an impressive looking cable car you can take towards the bridge.

Another ‘attraction’ in the same area is an [abandoned railway station](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%84%ED%98%84%EC%97%AD). It apparently was in use as a tourist attraction where you can cycle up and down the abandoned train tracks using special carts, but that attraction has, sadly, been abandoned as well.

*Other things in Wonju*  
There is the free Wonju history museum which i guess might be interesting if you can read Korean (there was very little signage in English). There is a nice museum garden, which includes a replica of the childhood home of former president Choi Kyu-hah, who was born in Wonju.

There’s a pleasant park around the river in the centre of the city, around the 치악교 bridge.

I can also recommend to stroll around the Wonju Jungang market for a bit.

1hdynxs,Seoul 8 day solo trip November ,293,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdynxs,1734165476.0,"After solo travelling earlier this year for the first time, I (28M) decided to take a solo trip to Seoul for 8 days - here’s what I did!


Day 1 Saturday: Arrived at ICN around 22:15, took out some won from an ATM (they seem to charge anywhere from 3000-5000+ fees from what I saw), bought a T Money card from a CU store for 4000 won, jumped on one of the last AREX all stop trains that night to Hongik, late snack from GS25 and checked into accommodation + sleep. It helped to research latest train times beforehand since if I spent too much time going through the airport, I may have missed the last train and would’ve needed to take a taxi or other transport. AREX is nice and cheap, around 4000 won to get to where I needed for only 1 hour and 10 mins or so.


Day 2 Sunday: Had an early start and walked to Gyeongui Line Forest Park. Had some French toast and a coffee at Yeontral Dabang which was owned by an old couple, super cute. Did some shopping in Hongdae as I had a list of things to get for friends and family from Olive Young - my god did I get a headache first time I walked into a store, soooo many products to choose from. Also found it amusing how staff greets a customer and then everyone else will follow up like a symphony. I had my passport on my at all times for tax free purchases - some places are instant refund and some you have to process at the airport.


Then instead of going to Myeongdong Market, I walked to Mangwon Market instead where it seemed mostly locals went. Got some seeded hotteok from a basement store near one of the entrances which was super busy, tried so-tteok too. All delicious. Then back to Hongdae for more shopping, watching street performances and I found a Korean fried chicken restaurant that caters to solo eaters as you can order half a portion. Chicken in the Kitchen - great spot came here twice. After some more street performance watching, went back to accommodation after picking up one of the viral chestnut tiramisus from the Netflix show and ate that (it was ok) before going to sleep.


Day 3 Monday: I was initially going to go to the War Memorial + National Museum but I didn’t realise the War Memorial was closed on Mondays, so saved this for another day. Spent a few hours at the National Museum where it was mostly Korean school kids on school trips. Interior was impressive and I needed another chill day after recovering from jet lag. After I walked to another cute cafe, Miss Lalla for a chocolate roll slice and coffee. It was a cute place and the cake was good but not amazing. The owner completed a French pastry Diploma and this was proudly presented in the main room which was cool to see.


Killed some time at the Starfield Mall buying gifts, Starfield Library was all Christmasfied with the lights but it was completely packed so I took a quick picture and left. Tried Korean McDonald’s and got a Supreme Shrimp burger and a bulbolgi burger, both yummy. The quality and price of fast food here was so much better than back home (UK). Explored Bongeunsa Temple at night for a peaceful walk before heading back to Hongdae for some KBBQ at a place that caters to solo eaters, Hongojib. Really recommend this place as it’s very affordable and the quality is great. I saw a lot of solo Koreans eat here too, not just tourists.


Day 4 Tuesday: Super early start for a 7am meet up to go on a DMZ tour (booked through Klook). Went to Majang Lake Bridge which was arguably better than the other options (another bridge and boat ride), Imjingak for the memorial village and then finally the observatory and then third tunnel. They warned us it would be a difficult trek down/up but I found the worst part was having to walk hunched over to get to the end of the tunnel as the ceiling got lower and lower, my back was killing me as a 6ft person, and this was way harder than the steep slope up imo. Overall most people in normal shape will be able to do this so don’t worry too much. Finished off the trip with a Korean buffet and browsed the gift shop - is the skin care/ginseng actually worth it here? I was a bit skeptical since the tour guides were really hyping it but maybe the stuff was just that good - let me know if you felt the same!


I was so tired after getting back (4:30pm) to Hongdae, went for a haircut at a foreigner friendly barber which was excellent, tried the chicken burgers at Moms Touch and picked up some CVS food on the way home. Also managed to find a really cute Cinnamonroll T Money key chain from the Cinnamonroll cafe store at AK plaza. Wasn’t cheap (18k) but it was worth it and now exists on my phone strap.


Day 5 Wednesday: All day Lotte world! I found discounted tickets on trip.com so jumped on the train and went to Lotte world, easy pick up using the qr code and in I went. At this time it was snowing a lot and I didn’t realise it was the heaviest snow Korea has seen for over 100 years!


I didn’t get the magic pass which was a mistake - a lot of the cool rollercoasters had such long lines (2-3 hours easily for French Revolution) but I managed to get on the conquistador after waiting 40 mins or so. I tried as many rides as I could, the fly venture ride was really cool and worth lining up for, sinbad ride was really busy earlier on so I waited until end of the day and didn’t have to queue up for long - this one had 2-3 unexpected short drops but otherwise was a laid back ride. There was a Pubg experience which was pretty neat - think time crisis in different rooms with 4d effects.


For an amusement park, the food and drink here was very reasonable - around £3-3.50 for each item whereas back home it would cost double/triple easily. How cool is that popcorn chicken and coke cup combo? Due to the snow, they closed the outdoor rides but it was still nice to take pictures of the famous lotte castle with the snow falling. After I went to Seoul Sky (pre booked tickets) almost before closing time and it was a good time to visit, hardly anyone there! Back to Hongdae for some dakgalbi which was min order 2 people (I finished 90% of it) and right outside the restaurant there was a old guy just solo dancing to some music in the snow - pretty sure I saw him dance to APT with someone on reddit before lol so probably same guy.


Day 5 Thursday: Pre booked a hanbok photoshoot at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, super cool experience and the pictures turned out great with the snowy backdrop. Despite the cold, I managed to walk to Bukchon Hanok Village and picked up a hot coffee on the way back at Cafe Lotus (also run by a cute elderly couple).

After getting changed, headed to Namusae Tea House for some bingsu (lol) and hot tea, this place was cosy and really pretty inside but just be warned the prices are quite expensive- my bingsu was 18k alone which would’ve been a KBBQ meal for one easily! There were mostly tourists here although I did see some Koreans. Still a nice way to keep out the cold for an hour or two.


Went to Gwangjang Market for some street food and man was it packed. Tbh I only got the twisted rice doughnut which was hot and crispy with a slight chew, and some dumplings from a store outside the market (Wang Mandu) which were delicious. Back to town for some more shopping and tried Lotteria - the ordering system was so cool - no interaction with staff needed, just order on the kiosk and when your order is ready, scan your receipt and pick up your order from a window you knock on. I got a hanwoo burger set that hit the spot.


Day 6 Friday: I was feeling a bit low energy at this point after doing 25-30k steps everyday so I got up really late and headed to the War Memorial. Before going, stopped off at a tonkatsu place for lunch near Samgakji Station (Tonkatsu Parwol).


Spent 3 hours learning about history, great museum and some parts about the Korean War made me emotional which usually never happens to me. Anyway to cheer myself up I went back to Hongdae for some Korean corn dogs and fried mandu! Back to the apt for a freshen up and headed out again on pre booked bar crawl. Spent the next 5 hours partying it up (still impressed by how hard Koreans can party) and then stumbling into a lamb skewer restaurant for some well needed food. I would recommend booking one of these bar crawls as I wouldn’t have explored the clubbing/nightlife otherwise. It was fun as a solo traveler/introvert!


Day 7 Saturday: Another late start to the day - tried a cafe called The Piehole in Sinchon. It was ok, I got a chocolate pecan pie slice and a cinnamon latte but I should’ve chosen a more popular pie. Hopped on the train to DDP and spent a few hours there. Some really cool exhibits at the DDP showroom, rotating camera video, infinity walk etc. Back to Hongdae (lol how many times have I said this) for some skin care shopping and more KBBQ, street busking watching and Korean fried chicken (same places as before).


Day 8 Sunday: Namdaemun Market although I only really saw one food stall which was a hotteok stall and had so many people lined up, so naturally I too joined. Was it worth the 30 minute wait? I think so as I hadn’t gotten to try a yachae hotteok yet and I needed something hot to start my hike. It was crispy and hot, but the noodles inside were a little soft. For the price, can’t beat it (3k). Bought 2, ate one on the way and saved the other for when I got to the top at N Seoul tower.


The hike to the top took around an hour and was a nice leg workout. Made the hotteok taste good even it was cold by that point. Spent some time taking in the views with a coffee but didn’t feel the need to go up into the tower. I did consider taking the cable car down but the price seemed extortionate and the actual amount of people in each car looked uncomfortable so I walked down. Found a 24 hour soup restaurant in Hongdae and got a bibimbap set with sundubu jjigae. The most vegetables I’ve eaten on my trip so far lol. It was very affordable (11k?) and tasty for my final meal.


Day 9 Monday: Doesn’t really count since I had to get up at 4am to catch my flight at 9am! But in retrospect I probably didn’t need to arrive at the airport so early, but wanted to just in case. Found a tax refund kiosk and inputted my details, after checking in luggage and going through to security, i found the office for tax refunds and managed to get some won back from the machine (as i will surely be back). Jumped on my long flight back home.

Also found it amusing how staff greets a customer and then everyone else will follow up like a symphony. I had my passport on my at all times for tax free purchases - some places are instant refund and some you have to process at the airport.


Then instead of going to Myeongdong Market, I walked to Mangwon Market instead where it seemed mostly locals went. Got some seeded hotteok from a basement store near one of the entrances which was super busy, tried so-tteok too. All delicious. Then back to Hongdae for more shopping, watching street performances and I found a Korean fried chicken restaurant that caters to solo eaters as you can order half a portion. Chicken in the Kitchen - great spot came here twice. After some more street performance watching, went back to accommodation after picking up one of the viral chestnut tiramisus from the Netflix show and ate that (it was ok) before going to sleep.


Day 3 Monday: I was initially going to go to the War Memorial + National Museum but I didn’t realise the War Memorial was closed on Mondays, so saved this for another day. Spent a few hours at the National Museum where it was mostly Korean school kids on school trips. Interior was impressive and I needed another chill day after recovering from jet lag. After I walked to another cute cafe, Miss Lalla for a chocolate roll slice and coffee. It was a cute place and the cake was good but not amazing. The owner completed a French pastry Diploma and this was proudly presented in the main room which was cool to see.


Killed some time at the Starfield Mall buying gifts, Starfield Library was all Christmasfied with the lights but it was completely packed so I took a quick picture and left. Tried Korean McDonald’s and got a Supreme Shrimp burger and a bulbolgi burger, both yummy. The quality and price of fast food here was so much better than back home (UK). Explored Bongeunsa Temple at night for a peaceful walk before heading back to Hongdae for some KBBQ at a place that caters to solo eaters, Hongojib. Really recommend this place as it’s very affordable and the quality is great. I saw a lot of solo Koreans eat here too, not just tourists.


Day 4 Tuesday: Super early start for a 7am meet up to go on a DMZ tour (booked through Klook). Went to Majang Lake Bridge which was arguably better than the other options (another bridge and boat ride), Imjingak for the memorial village and then finally the observatory and then third tunnel. They warned us it would be a difficult trek down/up but I found the worst part was having to walk hunched over to get to the end of the tunnel as the ceiling got lower and lower, my back was killing me as a 6ft person, and this was way harder than the steep slope up imo. Overall most people in normal shape will be able to do this so don’t worry too much. Finished off the trip with a Korean buffet and browsed the gift shop - is the skin care/ginseng actually worth it here? I was a bit skeptical since the tour guides were really hyping it but maybe the stuff was just that good - let me know if you felt the same!


I was so tired after getting back (4:30pm) to Hongdae, went for a haircut at a foreigner friendly barber which was excellent, tried the chicken burgers at Moms Touch and picked up some CVS food on the way home. Also managed to find a really cute Cinnamonroll T Money key chain from the Cinnamonroll cafe store at AK plaza. Wasn’t cheap (18k) but it was worth it and now exists on my phone strap.


Day 5 Wednesday: All day Lotte world! I found discounted tickets on trip.com so jumped on the train and went to Lotte world, easy pick up using the qr code and in I went. At this time it was snowing a lot and I didn’t realise it was the heaviest snow Korea has seen for over 100 years!


I didn’t get the magic pass which was a mistake - a lot of the cool rollercoasters had such long lines (2-3 hours easily for French Revolution) but I managed to get on the conquistador after waiting 40 mins or so. I tried as many rides as I could, the fly venture ride was really cool and worth lining up for, sinbad ride was really busy earlier on so I waited until end of the day and didn’t have to queue up for long - this one had 2-3 unexpected short drops but otherwise was a laid back ride. There was a Pubg experience which was pretty neat - think time crisis in different rooms with 4d effects.


For an amusement park, the food and drink here was very reasonable - around £3-3.50 for each item whereas back home it would cost double/triple easily. How cool is that popcorn chicken and coke cup combo? Due to the snow, they closed the outdoor rides but it was still nice to take pictures of the famous lotte castle with the snow falling. After I went to Seoul Sky (pre booked tickets) almost before closing time and it was a good time to visit, hardly anyone there! Back to Hongdae for some dakgalbi which was min order 2 people (I finished 90% of it) and right outside the restaurant there was a old guy just solo dancing to some music in the snow - pretty sure I saw him dance to APT with someone on reddit before lol so probably same guy.


Day 5 Thursday: Pre booked a hanbok photoshoot at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, super cool experience and the pictures turned out great with the snowy backdrop. Despite the cold, I managed to walk to Bukchon Hanok Village and picked up a hot coffee on the way back at Cafe Lotus (also run by a cute elderly couple).

After getting changed, headed to Namusae Tea House for some bingsu (lol) and hot tea, this place was cosy and really pretty inside but just be warned the prices are quite expensive- my bingsu was 18k alone which would’ve been a KBBQ meal for one easily! There were mostly tourists here although I did see some Koreans. Still a nice way to keep out the cold for an hour or two.


Went to Gwangjang Market for some street food and man was it packed. Tbh I only got the twisted rice doughnut which was hot and crispy with a slight chew, and some dumplings from a store outside the market (Wang Mandu) which were delicious. Back to town for some more shopping and tried Lotteria - the ordering system was so cool - no interaction with staff needed, just order on the kiosk and when your order is ready, scan your receipt and pick up your order from a window you knock on. I got a hanwoo burger set that hit the spot.


Day 6 Friday: I was feeling a bit low energy at this point after doing 25-30k steps everyday so I got up really late and headed to the War Memorial. Before going, stopped off at a tonkatsu place for lunch near Samgakji Station (Tonkatsu Parwol).


Spent 3 hours learning about history, great museum and some parts about the Korean War made me emotional which usually never happens to me. Anyway to cheer myself up I went back to Hongdae for some Korean corn dogs and fried mandu! Back to the apt for a freshen up and headed out again on pre booked bar crawl. Spent the next 5 hours partying it up (still impressed by how hard Koreans can party) and then stumbling into a lamb skewer restaurant for some well needed food. I would recommend booking one of these bar crawls as I wouldn’t have explored the clubbing/nightlife otherwise. It was fun as a solo traveler/introvert!


Day 7 Saturday: Another late start to the day - tried a cafe called The Piehole in Sinchon. It was ok, I got a chocolate pecan pie slice and a cinnamon latte but I should’ve chosen a more popular pie. Hopped on the train to DDP and spent a few hours there. Some really cool exhibits at the DDP showroom, rotating camera video, infinity walk etc. Back to Hongdae (lol how many times have I said this) for some skin care shopping and more KBBQ, street busking watching and Korean fried chicken (same places as before).


Day 8 Sunday: Namdaemun Market although I only really saw one food stall which was a hotteok stall and had so many people lined up, so naturally I too joined. Was it worth the 30 minute wait? I think so as I hadn’t gotten to try a yachae hotteok yet and I needed something hot to start my hike. It was crispy and hot, but the noodles inside were a little soft. For the price, can’t beat it (3k). Bought 2, ate one on the way and saved the other for when I got to the top at N Seoul tower.


The hike to the top took around an hour and was a nice leg workout. Made the hotteok taste good even it was cold by that point. Spent some time taking in the views with a coffee but didn’t feel the need to go up into the tower. I did consider taking the cable car down but the price seemed extortionate and the actual amount of people in each car looked uncomfortable so I walked down. Found a 24 hour soup restaurant in Hongdae and got a bibimbap set with sundubu jjigae. The most vegetables I’ve eaten on my trip so far lol. It was very affordable (11k?) and tasty for my final meal.


Day 9 Monday: Doesn’t really count since I had to get up at 4am to catch my flight at 9am! But in retrospect I probably didn’t need to arrive at the airport so early, but wanted to just in case. Found a tax refund kiosk and inputted my details, after checking in luggage and going through to security, i found the office for tax refunds and managed to get some won back from the machine (as i will surely be back). Jumped on my long flight back home.


Feel free to ask any questions :) Pictures are so pretty. Makes me want to book a solo trip asap! | It's so great that you got to see this gorgeous city in two seasons in just one trip!
The pictures are wonderful, the last is just sooo cute ♥️ | if possible, tell us more on bar crawls? Was it easy to connect as english is proba the only languauge we can communicate with them.

We made our own itinerary using tiktok recommendations. When we visited the place, we were pretty bummed. Some of the restaurants actually didn't taste any good. We finally asked locals (driver and convenience store clerk) what their recommendations are, and they gave us some restaurants that we never heard of and CHEAP for us! 
We also tried to follow where the crowd went, and we tried so many good places. Locals are happy to give recommendations to us foreigners if we ask them, so just ask! It was the best decision for us ever!


edit: resto -> restaurant.


I only followed a few restaurant recommendations from tik tok in my itinerary cause it wasn't that great. After that we tried to find everything by ourselves. 
Since some of you are asking, here are the things I can share to you:
1. For me and my friends personally, Samyookga banchan wasn't that great (pls dont take it personally). Also, the pork neck was better than the flower pork belly
2. For chicken, we tried bhc chicken twice and olive chicken once. We agreed olive chicken is better than bhc chicken for savory taste. Bhc chicken was too sweet to our palate 
3. Gimgane was pretty good and cheap. A clerk recommended us this gimbap restaurant. If you want something full, their cheese pork cutlet was huge with lots of cheeseeee. Gimbap tasted awesome! 
4. 31cm busan was a no go for us. It tasted kinda bland, but they served us a lot of clams. If you like clams, you will like it. 
5. Haeundae traditional market. We tried one of the seafood restaurants, it was expensive and we didn't like it at all. But, they served us everything fresh.
6. Hotteok at haeundae traditional market was soooo frickin great! Just go to the most crowded one
7. Myeongdong street food was sooo expensive 
8. Geukdong dwaeji gukbap wasss soooo good! If I go to korea again, I will surely go there
9. For kbbq, 1974 Kbbq restaurant in gangnam was amazing. We had dinner twice over there. Ahjussi was so nice, and the place was so homey. Sadly, the restaurant wasn't that big.
10. Myeongdong kyoja was also good. I think the best part was the dumpling.

1jx71jh,Trip Report,226,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx71jh,1744424709.0,"One week: Seoul and Sokcho (first Korea visit)

Focus: hiking, food, tours

I loved reading other people's trip reports and found it helpful for planning our trip so I thought I'd through our experience in. 

Day One: Arrived in Seoul-stayed in Myeongdong. We went to Myeongdong Kyo Ja for dinner, we would highly recommend, we had a chicken broth soup and a tray of dumplings. You will line up to order, once you reach the server they will ask you to pick the items you would like, there are about four menu options. Pick what you'd like and pay in advance. They are very quick about rotating people through the restaurant so the line will go fast. 

Day  Two: A very long day, we hit up Seoul Tower, Gyeongbokgung Palace/Folk Museum, Bukchon Hanok Village, and Namdaemun Market. We also tried Myeongdong Croquettes, a cute little bakery with great croquettes, try the red bean one. 

Day Three: DMZ tour-we booked through Klook and it was worth it as we hadn't been to Korea before. On the tour we got to try soybean icecream, we enjoyed it a lot more than we thought we would. It almost has a peanut butter-esqe flavor. We also walked through Myeongdong Night Market. We preferred Namdaemun over Myeongdong. Myeongdong was very busy and it was hard to look at each stall. Namdaemun also has clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, etc. so you can look through that between bites of hotteok and tteokbokki. 

Day Four: Trip to Sokcho, we caught the express bus from Seoul. We caught the local bus Seoraksan National Park and hiked to Biryong falls/observatory. We ended up doing the hike quite late, but that worked out for us because we were some of the last people leaving the park. We spotted a raccoon-dog just as we were leaving (this is a huge win for us, we wanted to see one while hiking in Japan and few years back but couldn't find any). We also tried marinated crab. I'm not sure if it was because it was the off season but restaurants were closing up around 8pm, so plan accordingly, Naver and google maps didn't always have accurate hours for places. 

Day Five: Back to Seoraksan, we hiked Ulsanbawi Rock-be prepared for stairs! Afterwards we went to the fish market, you'll see locals wandering around with white boxes of chicken-follow them! Other stalls will try to distract you with other chicken, don't give in, you need to try the original. There are two stalls at the market, they are white with a red chicken head logo-it's called Mansuk Dak Gangjeong. Try their fried chicken, they will hand you a box, it will be cold but don't be alarmed, it is fantastic. The sauce has a bit of spice with some peppers but is also sweet and sour. 

Day Six: Back to Seoul. Before we left Sokcho we stopped at Chungchodam for coffee. We had a phenomenal sesame latte. The cafe is very trendy and the latte was great, highly recommend. We did a pub crawl through Hongdae, we booked it through Klook. This was not exactly what we expected, the bars we went to were clearly set aside for tourists and didn't give an authentic experience. The plus side was meeting some other lovely folks who were travelling and sharing some tips. The downside hit us the next morning; soju will give you one hell of a hangover. 

Day Seven: It was a rainy day so we tried to find indoor activities. We went to the war and women's rights museum, it was interesting to learn more about the comfort women system. We also went to Lotte mall and got a new pair of glasses + free eye exam from Davich Opitical. We also wandered around Lotte world and checked out the cherry blossoms. Luckily our lovely hotel host gave us umbrellas or this day would have been a bit of a wash. 

Day Eight: We walked through Hongdae shopping street. I like to collect cute art/earrings from different places we travel to. We went to Object and found a few post cards and stickers. Then we caught our flight home!

1fjmjxy,Korea trip review🫰🏼,218,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1fjmjxy/korea_trip_review/,1726641934.0,"29M from India finally went to Korea with my sister (OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL TRIP) and i miss it already🫰🏼. Fell in love with everything will try to breakdown below. 

Transport - This was my first international trip so i can't really compare with any other country. But in comparison with my own country, traveling and understanding the train and bus system was really really easy and time efficient.

Navigation - It was so great and Naver map really is a saviour as it precisely shows which train or bus to take, where to get down and which exit to take from station. Learned how to navigate on first day itself and that's it i was traveling like a pro as if I've been living in Korea for many years😂😂.

People - Although they may seem rude or ignorant at first but i was wrong. They're the sweetest when you speak with them. If they know English they'll go above and beyond to help you, even if they don't they'll still try. Everyone spoke with us with smiles on their faces.

Old people have my heart🫰🏼they'll make you feel like their own child. If you don't know how to eat something in their food stall they'll try to show. An old lady running a restaurant gave us sweets before we left.

Racism - Before going to Korea many articles, youtubers and reddit post made me feel anxious about getting discriminated. But guess what i experienced no racism at all, nobody changed their seats on metro or bus when we sat beside them, nobody made us feel unsafe, infact i was roaming everywhere without any fear, spoke with locals without hesitation.

While Seoul was easy going and relaxed but Busan, i really couldn't connect (NOT DEGRADING THE CITY). Just like i said before people are sweetest but both old and young people in Busan couldn't speak English so it was a bit difficult and it's not there fault. We got few looks from oldies but we didn't mind.

Shopping - i went with my sister and it was paradise for her but for men i feel clothes are expensive (CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG).

Food - I'll belive if someone is vegan or pure vegetarian will have bit of a hard time finding suitable food. Those who eat non veg should be open to trying other meat items as chicken is not served in every place. (CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG)

Papago for translation, Klook to book activities and Naver for navigation are must have apps.

FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ANYTHING OR CORRECT ME IF SAID ANYTHING WRONG.",70,Trip Report!,"Awesome, glad you enjoyed your trip! I notice from keeping tabs on this sub, that most Indians' trip reviews are all like:

Before trip: OMG they're going to hate me!

After trip: OMG they didn't hate me! WTF social media! | As a Korean, I am very proud to read this post. You have a very good understanding.

There are big cultural differences between Busan and Seoul, and Busan is a bit closer to the countryside. So there are many elderly people and they look at foreigners strangely. As a side note, everything in Korea is currently concentrated in the metropolitan area, which is causing major social problems.

Also, in Korea, there are some communities that misunderstand Indians, but most people do not have racism or bad feelings toward Indians.

Some Indians often appear in the Korean entertainment industry, and the response from Koreans is very positive.

India will be a great partner for Korea in politics, diplomacy, and economy in the future.

Thank you very much. | glad you enjoyed seoul. 
speaking of klook, i wonder what was your best several activities in seoul. 
i have friends visiting seoul soon so want to let them know.

and as a seoul citizen i dont have any bad impression of indians or asians. ah.. some chinese group tourists seemed not prepared for the trip but it's the reason they chose to take a group tour. koreans were the same decades ago. even nowadays. | I felt exactly like you. I did not experience any rudeness which i was mostly concerned with. Old folks were so nice and genuinely happy to see me walking around in hanbok . Everything was fantastic. Granted we were mostly around touristy areas | I relate to a lot that you've written and had a great experience as well. I am an Indian woman living in Seattle, this was my first international trip besides traveling between the US and India ever since I moved to the US in 2015 and I didn't know how my South Korea trip would pan out. I learnt how to read Hangul and speak a few words but that was it, I didn't put in more effort into prep.

I follow a vegan lifestyle and I had done my research on the vegan restaurants I wanted to visit when I was planning the trip, I was hoping I would have a great time having looked up all the delicious food. People might think that it would be a hard time being a vegan here but from my experience in the major cities, it didn't seem to be the case at all. The food was delicious, I loved each and every restaurant/cafe I went to and the sheer number of vegan restaurants/cafes still blows my mind! I previously used to think Seattle was a paradise for vegans but that was because I was living in a shell, the vegan food here in the places I visited (Seoul, Jeju, Busan) was way better.

The people I came across were all super kind. I was once confused on which train to take when I was in a train station, seeing me puzzled, a lady came to my rescue and helped me find my way out. I stayed in an airbnb that required ~100 steps of going up/down to get to the bus/train station. When I was heading back to the airport from the airbnb and was bringing my luggage down the stairs, a woman in the neighborhood came over to help me even without me asking for help. I haven't experienced either of these in India or in the US despite having lived there for a major part of my life. I loved taking public transportation here (I only used public transportation in my entire trip) and the connectivity is great. I felt super duper safe here compared to any city I've ever lived in or traveled to and I'm so grateful for it. The places I visited were all gorgeous and there was not one moment when I thought I was bored. I would love to be back here on a longer trip next time!","Korea trip review🫰🏼 29M from India finally went to Korea with my sister (OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL TRIP) and i miss it already🫰🏼. Fell in love with everything will try to breakdown below. 

Transport - This was my first international trip so i can't really compare with any other country. But in comparison with my own country, traveling and understanding the train and bus system was really really easy and time efficient.

Navigation - It was so great and Naver map really is a saviour as it precisely shows which train or bus to take, where to get down and which exit to take from station. Learned how to navigate on first day itself and that's it i was traveling like a pro as if I've been living in Korea for many years😂😂.

People - Although they may seem rude or ignorant at first but i was wrong. They're the sweetest when you speak with them. If they know English they'll go above and beyond to help you, even if they don't they'll still try. Everyone spoke with us with smiles on their faces.

Old people have my heart🫰🏼they'll make you feel like their own child. If you don't know how to eat something in their food stall they'll try to show. An old lady running a restaurant gave us sweets before we left.

Racism - Before going to Korea many articles, youtubers and reddit post made me feel anxious about getting discriminated. But guess what i experienced no racism at all, nobody changed their seats on metro or bus when we sat beside them, nobody made us feel unsafe, infact i was roaming everywhere without any fear, spoke with locals without hesitation.

While Seoul was easy going and relaxed but Busan, i really couldn't connect (NOT DEGRADING THE CITY). Just like i said before people are sweetest but both old and young people in Busan couldn't speak English so it was a bit difficult and it's not there fault. We got few looks from oldies but we didn't mind.

Shopping - i went with my sister and it was paradise for her but for men i feel clothes are expensive (CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG).

Food - I'll belive if someone is vegan or pure vegetarian will have bit of a hard time finding suitable food. Those who eat non veg should be open to trying other meat items as chicken is not served in every place. (CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG)

Papago for translation, Klook to book activities and Naver for navigation are must have apps.

FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ANYTHING OR CORRECT ME IF SAID ANYTHING WRONG. Awesome, glad you enjoyed your trip! I notice from keeping tabs on this sub, that most Indians' trip reviews are all like:

Before trip: OMG they're going to hate me!

After trip: OMG they didn't hate me! WTF social media! | As a Korean, I am very proud to read this post. You have a very good understanding.

There are big cultural differences between Busan and Seoul, and Busan is a bit closer to the countryside. So there are many elderly people and they look at foreigners strangely. As a side note, everything in Korea is currently concentrated in the metropolitan area, which is causing major social problems.

Also, in Korea, there are some communities that misunderstand Indians, but most people do not have racism or bad feelings toward Indians.

Some Indians often appear in the Korean entertainment industry, and the response from Koreans is very positive.

India will be a great partner for Korea in politics, diplomacy, and economy in the future.

Thank you very much. | glad you enjoyed seoul. 
speaking of klook, i wonder what was your best several activities in seoul. 
i have friends visiting seoul soon so want to let them know.

and as a seoul citizen i dont have any bad impression of indians or asians. ah.. some chinese group tourists seemed not prepared for the trip but it's the reason they chose to take a group tour. koreans were the same decades ago. even nowadays. | I felt exactly like you. I did not experience any rudeness which i was mostly concerned with. Old folks were so nice and genuinely happy to see me walking around in hanbok . Everything was fantastic. Granted we were mostly around touristy areas | I relate to a lot that you've written and had a great experience as well. I am an Indian woman living in Seattle, this was my first international trip besides traveling between the US and India ever since I moved to the US in 2015 and I didn't know how my South Korea trip would pan out. I learnt how to read Hangul and speak a few words but that was it, I didn't put in more effort into prep.

I follow a vegan lifestyle and I had done my research on the vegan restaurants I wanted to visit when I was planning the trip, I was hoping I would have a great time having looked up all the delicious food. People might think that it would be a hard time being a vegan here but from my experience in the major cities, it didn't seem to be the case at all. The food was delicious, I loved each and every restaurant/cafe I went to and the sheer number of vegan restaurants/cafes still blows my mind! I previously used to think Seattle was a paradise for vegans but that was because I was living in a shell, the vegan food here in the places I visited (Seoul, Jeju, Busan) was way better.

The people I came across were all super kind. I was once confused on which train to take when I was in a train station, seeing me puzzled, a lady came to my rescue and helped me find my way out.

Payment used:
Didn't bring any KWN cash. 
Most payment is via credit card, debit card, wow pass, t money or E-wallets which has QR code Alipay sign (with charges) 
I did withdraw KRW cash via Global ATM (with charges) to pay guide for tickets.  However, I discovered that I can transfer money via Wow pass (with krw500 charges) to guide's local bank.  

Apps used:
1. Naver Map
2. Papago translator 
3. Wow pass (pre book Wow pass with T money in the app) 
4. Seoul Subway
5. Uber (exclusive) 
6. Whatsapp
7.  Weather app

Things booked via klook:
1.  Esim
2.  Airport transfers 
3.  Private 10hrs tour to 3 location: Nami, Alpaca and Morning Calm Garden. 
4.  DMZ with Majang Bridge 

Booked private 8.5hrs Gyeongju tour and drive to Busan via Korea Go Tours. 

Booked KTX tickets (opened 30 days before travel dates) via http://www.letskorail.com desktop.  

Hotels used:
1. L7 Hondae 
2. L7 Haeundae 
3. Ibis Ambassador Myeodong 

Day 1 (Seoul) 
Arrived at Seoul mid noon.  Booked Airport transfer via Klook.

Reviews indicated Klook airport transfers can be a hit or miss.  Since I got a good deal at the time of booking, I decided to risk it.  Or else, you may choose to book Limo Bus or Uber taxi at the airport. I booked pick up time 2 hrs after landing to give enough time for clearing customs, pick up baggage, wow pass, esims, topups, cash withdrawal and etc. Klook gives 30mins free waiting time.

Things I did at the airport. 
- picked up prebooked Wow pass card at airport's CU convenience store.  Registered card to app and topup via app (with charges) linked to credit/debit card. 
- Topup T money via Wow pass app.  Strangely this can only be done for Samsung or Apple devices with NFC.  Tip if you have other brands phone, ask your friend who has Iphone or Samsung to log into your Wow Pass and transfer for you. Or else you will have to look for t money machine and use cash to topup.  You can transfer funds via Wow pass. But you cannot transfer funds via Tmoney. 
-Wow pass with Esim (local calls) package will have to be picked up at SK Telcos counter as they need to register your passport for local calls function. 

Checked into L7 Hongdae.  Hotel's location is very good.  Walking distance to shops and subway stations.  There is a wowpass machine in the hotel too where you can withdraw KRW directly with one of the 16 countries currencies. 

Things i did that day via subway ride:
- took 1hr ride subway to Gangnam area for color analysis. 
- Visited Starfield library. 
-ate at random restos at Hongdae
- Stroll and window shopped along Hongdae. 

Shops and restos opened till late. Most Koreans do not speak English or product labels are in Korean language, so Papago helps. 

Day 2 (Nami and surrounding) 
This is the only day i use cash to pay the driver for entrance upon his request. But i noticed if we were to get the tickets ourselves at the entrance, I can use card but maybe driver wants to earn commission.  So I let it go. 

Day tour to 3 locations below:

First stop Alpaca World.  Took 2.5 hrs plus drive from Seoul as it was super traffic.  Got there at around 945am.  Alpaca shows at 10am.  Its basically watching Alpacas running down the slop to be fed by tourist. Alpaca feed was provided by the marshals there. Spent maybe 1.5hrs there. 

Second stop Nami. Its a 1hr 15mins.  Then took a 5 to 10mins ferry ride there.  This place was made famous by Kdrama Winter Sonata.  Thus unless you are a fan, I won't recommend to purposely go there.  Had lunch on the Island and walked around.  Spent around 2 hrs there. 

Third stop Morning Calm Garden. Its a 40 mins drive. Walked around for 1.5hr or so.

Then back to Seoul.

This is already a private tour with no senior or children, we still ran overtime due to traffic.  Traffic took more than 4 hrs out of the 10hrs.  We started at Hondae at 740am and got back at 7pm. 

This is my PERSONAL opinion: 
It is not worth the long drive to those locations and expensive.  I find it's way way overhyped.  For the time spent on the road, it's better spent it elsewhere. There are many nice hikes near the city like Namsan.  

Day 3 (Seoul - Gyeongju day trip - Busan)

All payment via card for this day. 

Took 35mins Uber ride from Hongdae to Seoul Station for KTX train to Gyeongju.  It was easy to navigate the train station.  Train ride was around 2hrs 15mins.

KTX ride was seamless and straight forward.  Tickets were booked 30 days before travel dates since its a weekend and can get fully booked. 

Upon arrival at Singyeongju station, my private guide meet up with us at 1130am for an 8.5hrs tour including 1.5 hrs drive to Busan. 

1st stop Bulguksa Temple
Try not to go on weekend!! 
We went on a weekend and didn't expect heavy traffic in small town of Gyeongju.  Spent more than 1 hr time wasted on traffic into Bulguksa temple!!  

2nd stop Daereungwon (Cheonmachong Tomb).  We went inside the tomb museum.  It was interesting but small museum.  So it did not take long. 

3rd stop Hwangnidan-gil
This is a shopping streets.  Ate our lunch there.  Cold raw beef noodles was yummy.
Queued and tried the corn ice cream. Nothing to die for.  Note: if you don't like Q but want to try it, you can try it in Myeodong.  No queue there. 

Was disappointed guide didn't bring us to the Cheomseongdae Observatory  as it was just next to the tomb as she is somehow rushing to get us back to Busan.  

4th stop Gyochon village (the only interesting part is to cross the river in stone to view Woljeonggyo)

5th stop Woljeonggyo Bridge Wish we could have stayed till evening to see lited up.  Was very disappointed. 

- Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.  Same as 5th.

Then drive 1.5 hrs to Busan.  Checked in an L7 Haeundae.  Another nice hotel with good location.  There is Wow pass machine too and 7/11 in the hotel. 

Tip:  If you booked private day tour with limited time, I would recommend the tour start a little late so you can watch the lights lit up on the Woljeonggyo bridge and Donggung Palace. 

With this stopover, it creates some problem with luggages.  Thus I'd suggest either:
-stay overnight in Gyeongju or
-leave luggage at Gyeongju KTX station (ktx is around 30min to 45 mins to Bulguksa). After tour, go back to KTX station and proceed to Busan. 
- Take bus from Gyeongju station to city and leave luggage in city lockers (I dont know where but I watched youtube there is) . Tour around.  Thereafter take intercity bus to Busan. 
- Pack necessary things in backpack and leave luggage in your hotel in seoul or rent a locker. 
- or hire private tour or vehicle to bring you around with pur luggages then drop you off at Busan. 
- stay 3 nights in Busan and do day trip. 

Day 4 (Busan) 
Free and easy.  
Used uber going around these places since we have limited time. 

All payment via card for this day. 

-Gamcheon culture village. 
-Songdo park and cable car ride with bridge walk. 
-Huinnyeoul Culture Village
-Haeundae Blue Line Park

From Haeundae to Gamcheon takes around 30 mins.  Activities listed centered around those areas except for the Blue Line Park. 

Highlight was Gamcheon culture village.  One can spend hours exploring the small alleyways taking ig photos or just enjoy the views.

Songdo park is another nice hiking place where one can spend hours!! 

Huinnyeoul culture village has a similar concept but at smaller scale. 

Haeundae beach area is another nice place to hike one end to the other.  As for the blue line train ride (i didnt to capsule), the whole stretch train track is around 4km.  For those who loves walking, I'd would suggest to buy one way then walk back. 

The other end of the beach (where Westin hotel is located) is another hike area.  

There a food Avenue in Haeundae which lots of choice.  There is a small food alley with seafood too where some places have long queues like 30mins.  Out of curiosity, we also join the queue for the tempura and hotteak pancake.  I find its nothing to die for.. its actually ""meh"" especially the tempuras...they just reheat it and its full of batter.  Its just not worth the queue.  I have eaten better ones.  

Day 5 (Busan to Seoul) 
Took 40mins uber ride from Haeundae to Busan KTX station back to Seoul.  

All payment via card this day. 

This time we stayed in Myeodong area. 

From Myeodong, we walked all the way to Namsan Radio Tower.  For hikers, just hike up and down instead of taking cable car.  One can spent hours there too if you enjoy hikes and nature and taking ig photos. 

After that, back to Myeodong for window shopping the street food which is open at around 4pm ish.

Street food vendors accepts card, E Wallets (with QR code sign) and cash. 

Day 6 (DMZ with Majang Bridge) 
Tour starts at 7am meeting at one of the exit in Myeongdong station.  It was a rainy amd foggy day. 

Tours starts almost on time. Can't see anything due to the rain and heavy fog.  

Visited 3rd tunnel.  
Note: This does not suit disabled or unfit or claustrophobic persons as it is a steep climb back.. 

After that, had lunch in a village with a small shops selling local produce.  

Then headed to Majang Bridge park.  I like this place.  Hikers will like it too.  Since we join tour, there is time limit. 

Got back by around 4:30pm

Day 7

 Full day DIY tour 
Walked from Myeodong to Gyeongbokgung Palace.  On the way, passed by 'The Stream'. 

Entrance to palace is krw3000.  Free if you wear hanbok.  Rent hanbok starts from kwn9000 per hr to cheapest krw15000 whole day.  We wanted to get the 15000 whole day however the queue was too long.  So instead of wasting time, we rented from a shop with hairdo for krw45000 for 4hrs.

Spent 3hrs walking and taking photos there. 

Next walked from Gyeongbokgung to Bukchon Village.  Its a residential area. The highlights is the alley with hanok style houses. 

On the way saw a Michelin star original ginseng chicken soup.  So had a late lunch. 

Then back to Myeodong.  Ate yummy street food there. All popular korean brands are there. 

Day 8
Check out. 
Rode 1hr uber XL to incheon airport. 

Re tax refund, some shops accepts direct tax refund while some have kiosk where you scan the details.  Bring your passport. 
There is also kiosk in the airport before and after immigration.  Choosed USD tax refund.  Queue and process was fast for me tho didnt buy much. 

Hope this helps. ",25,Trip Report,"Don’t mess with the sheriff of 북촌한옥마을 | Thank you for fabulous tips👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻🥰💖in Jeju island atm having been in Seoul n stayed at Hongdae L7 too!

Would you mind sharing much is the Uber from Haeundae to Busan Station? | That’s awesome! We were just there in early April for cherry blossom and hit a lot of the same spots. I didn’t make it to gamcheon village but will do that next time.

For the luggage transfer from Seoul to busan we bought a klook service to move our big luggage from L7 Gangnam to Signiel busan but it took a day. We didn’t go back to Seoul like you did though"
1kdp5pr,7 underrated Korean dishes locals actually love (not just BBQ & bibimbap),180,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kdp5pr/7_underrated_korean_dishes_locals_actually_love/,1746265219.0,"When most people think of Korean food, it’s usually bulgogi, bibimbap, or samgyeopsal. But if you ask actual Koreans what they *crave*, you'll get a very different list.

Here are 7 dishes that locals genuinely love — and that you probably *won’t* find on a “Top 10 Korean Foods” blog post:

**1. 간장게장 (Ganjang Gejang – Soy-marinated raw crab)**  
Often called “rice thief” (*bapdoduk*) because it’s so addictive with rice. Raw crab marinated in soy sauce until the meat turns buttery and rich. Intimidating at first, unforgettable once you try it.

**2. 감자탕 (Gamjatang – Pork backbone stew)**  
Hearty, spicy, and perfect for late nights or hangovers. Big chunks of pork, potatoes, perilla leaves, and a savory broth. Usually served for two or more — go with friends!

**3. 낙지볶음 (Nakji Bokkeum – Spicy stir-fried octopus)**  
Chewy, spicy, and super satisfying. Often mixed with noodles (*낙지볶음 + 쫄면*) or rice. Not for the faint of heart — the spice level can sneak up on you.

**4. 육회비빔밥 (Yukhoe Bibimbap – Raw beef mixed rice)**  
Think Korean beef tartare, but with rice, pear slices, and egg yolk. Rich but refreshing. You’ll find it in local markets like Gwangjang.

**5. 닭한마리 (Dak Hanmari – “One Whole Chicken” Soup)**  
You get a whole chicken in a clear broth, and you cook it yourself at the table. Add noodles at the end. It’s simple, healthy, and super comforting.

**6. 코다리조림 (Braised semi-dried pollack)**  
Slightly chewy fish braised in a spicy-sweet sauce. It’s like Korea’s version of comfort food. Usually found in local lunch spots (*백반집*).

**7. 청국장 (Cheonggukjang – Fermented soybean stew)**  
Warning: This one *smells* strong. Like, really strong. But locals swear by it for gut health and deep umami flavor. Eat it with rice and kimchi — it’s powerful, funky, and delicious.

If you want to eat like a local, go beyond the tourist staples and try some of these!

2. Kkomak bibimbap/ blood cockles. I know u asked for something other than bibimbap but I think this one is not v well known. I love blood cockles but it's not something I expected to find in south Korea! This one I've managed to make back home.
3. Busan hotteok. I can find hotteok here but none stuffed with all the seeds and nuts like busan!

Sharing our itinerary, general tips & advice, our experience driving in Jeju, and shopping tips.

# ITINERARY

We did 6 nights in Seoul, 3 nights in Busan, 5 nights in Jeju, and 1 night in Seoul at the end of the trip. Given how much time we had for the whole trip, I wouldn't change how we divided up the cities. For Seoul, keep in mind that it's a massive city and things may be far away from each other. Even though the subway is an efficient way of getting around, some neighbourhoods are an hour away. There are also a TON of stairs, so I'd recommend good shoes for lots of walking. Biggest tip is not to try to do too much in one day. Our days in Seoul felt full without being rushed or overwhelming.

* **Day 1:** landed at ICN at 6pm. Took the AREX to Seoul Station, bought a T-money card on the AREX, then took the subway to our hotel in Dongdaemun.
* **Day 2:** walked to Gwangjang Market for breakfast. Bought a Climate Card from 7-Eleven and reloaded it at the subway station for 5 days. Took the subway to Hongdae and customized a bunch of items at the Nike store. Stumbled upon a Harry Potter cafe in Hongdae while we waited for our custom Nike products. Took the subway to Myeongdong to go shopping.
* **Day 3:** did a colour analysis with Cocory. Took the subway to Gangnam for lunch. Went to a golf simulator to kill time before our skincare appointment at ShineBeam. We did a skincare analysis and treatments based on our analysis results. Had dinner and went to a rooftop bar in Gangnam before heading back to the hotel.
* **Day 4:** went back to Myeongdong for some shopping before heading to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We planned to visit the palaces and shrines, but it was Armed Forces Day and the palaces and shrines were closed. Walked around Bukchon Hanok Village and visited the National Folk Museum instead.
* **Day 5:** DMZ half day tour that we booked through Klook. The tour took us to the Dora Observatory where you can see North Korea across the Imjin River, Imjingak Peace Park with the Freedom Bridge, and the Third Tunnel. When we arrived at the Third Tunnel, there had just been an explosion and the tunnels were filled with gas / smoke. We ended up not being allowed to go down to the tunnel for safety reasons. Got back to Seoul around 4:30pm. Explored the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and walked along Cheonggyecheon Stream at sunset before going for dinner in the area.
* **Day 6:** hiked Baegundae Peak in Bukhansan National Park, the tallest peak in Seoul. We didn’t know that it was a national holiday, so the trail was PACKED. When we got to the summit, there was an hour long line to take a photo at the very top. The views of Seoul from the summit are incredible and even though it was crowded, it was a great hike.
* **Day 7:** took the KTX to Busan. Walked along Haeundae Beach and had Dwaeji Gukbap for dinner, a traditional Busan meal of pork and rice soup. Went to an arcade along the strip before heading back to our hotel.
* **Day 8:** spent the day at Spa Land Centum City for a jjimjilbang (traditional Korean bathhouse) experience. We did the baths and got a full body scrub (separated by gender), and then met up to do the saunas and relaxation rooms together. The spa has a self-serve ramen bar that we went to for lunch. There were also amazing massage chairs that cost ₩3,000 for 15 minutes. Took the subway back to our hotel, went for dinner and went back to the arcade.
* **Day 9:** We wanted to do the Sky Capsules, but didn’t book in advance and the earliest slot available for that day was 3pm, so we skipped it. Took the Haeundae Beach Train instead. We got off at the last stop and Ubered to the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. Ubered back to the train station and got off at various stops to have lunch, do the Skywalk, and go for grilled clams at Doheenae in Cheongsapo.
* **Day 10:** flew to Jeju and picked up our rental car. Drove to Bong Bong’s Tangerine Farm. We were a few weeks too early for tangerine picking season, but we had a coffee at the cafe, met Bong Bong the golden retriever, and walked around the farm.
* **Day 11:** visited Osulloc Tea Museum to see the green tea fields. The Innisfree flagship store is part of the property and there are 2 cafes there. Drove to the Jeongbang Waterfall and then the Seogwipo Maeil Olle Traditional Market for lunch. Walked around Seogwipo before heading back to the hotel. Went out for dinner at a chicken katsu and udon place.
* **Day 12:** went to the Cheonjeyeon Waterfall and then Daepo Jusangjeolli Cliff to see the basalt columns. Went for noodles and then came back to Daepo Jusangjeolli Cliff to do Olle Trail 8, but it started raining so hard we had to turn back shortly after starting it.
* **Day 13:** drove to Hallasan National Park. We wanted to hike to the summit, but you need to reserve the 2 trails that reach the summit. The weather didn’t look great so we decided to hike the Yeongsil Trail instead, which gets you close to the summit. Incredible views of Jeju and Mt. Halla throughout the hike.
* **Day 14:** hiked Seongsan Ilchulbong, which is short and easy. Amazing views of Jeju from the top on one side, views of Tuff Cone on the other. Next to Seongsan Ilchulbong is where the Haenyeo women divers put on a performance. We had lunch at the restaurant next to the dive site, where you can eat the seafood they catch, and watched the 2pm show where they caught an octopus.
* **Day 15:** returned the rental car and flew back to Seoul. Went to Myeongdong for our hair appointment at Eco Jardin. We got the viral 18 step scalp treatment and a haircut. Went shopping in Myeongdong for more skincare before heading back to the hotel.
* **Day 16:** took the Airport Limousine Bus to the airport. Got to the airport early to claim our tax refunds.

# GENERAL KOREA TIPS

* You need cash for street food, markets, and reloading your transit card (foreign credit cards are not accepted for transit). Everywhere else we went accepted credit cards.
* Get a Climate Card for unlimited trips on the subway and bus in Seoul – we bought ours at 7-Eleven and then you load it at a subway station machine, where you can select how many days you want the card for. We took the subway everywhere so this was much cheaper than paying for each trip individually.
* Apps to download:
   * Google Translate - a lot of people do not speak English, we got by just fine using Google Translate, camera translation is especially helpful for menus
   * NAVER Maps - Google Maps does not work well in Korea, but we found searching for places to be hit or miss in NAVER. We used Google Maps to find places and then NAVER to navigate to them. Google Maps will not provide any driving or walking directions and transit directions are wonky. NAVER has amazing navigation and you can also see when the next bus / subway is coming.
   * k.ride - this is the foreigner version of Kakao T and works like Uber. We used both k.ride and Uber, we found Uber to be a little cheaper but it was good to have options. You should download this in advance as it required SMS verification to set up your account.
* There are tons of public restrooms all over Korea and they are all free and clean!
* If you plan to shop or get any skincare treatments, save Seoul for the end of the trip. I regret shopping at the start of the trip and having to lug all of our shopping around to Busan and Jeju. If you’re planning to do skincare treatments with downtime, doing this at the end of the trip would be better so you don’t look crazy while sightseeing.
   * You can get treatments based on your consultation and do not have to get the treatment you pre-booked (this was true for our skincare and hair appointments). There seemed to be a lot of flexibility to change / add treatments on the spot, but this may be clinic-dependent.
* There’s no tipping for food or services in Korea
* Bring your passport with you everywhere for tax refunds! Some places do immediate tax refunds and others will scan you passport and then you’ll have to get the refund at the airport.
* There are almost no public garbage cans in Korea, be prepared to hold on to your garbage until you get back to your hotel.
* Get an eSIM from Klook – they had more options and it was cheaper than Airalo. There is also free Wifi at most places.
* Glasses of wine at restaurants are super uncommon – you can buy bottles of wine at some restaurants and beer at every restaurant though.
* Liquids 100ml+ and beverages are allowed in your carry on for domestic flights
* It’s rude to drink or eat on the subway or bus
* There are a lot of Korean holidays in early October
   * Oct 1: Armed Forces Day
   * Oct 3: Gaecheonjeol (National Foundation Day)
   * Oct 9: Hangul Day
* Korea felt very safe, more so than the big city where we live in Canada – people leave their belongings unattended in restaurants and other public places while they use the washroom, etc. with no fear of them being stolen
* People in public do not seem to have the same situational awareness (? not sure how best to describe it) as we are used to in North America. For example, we were walking through a subway station at rush hour and the man in front of us abruptly stopped at the top of the middle of a set of stairs to check his phone without moving off to the side. People often cut you off while walking vs. going around you or waiting 2 seconds to let you go by first. It's also common for people to bump into you or push you aside (gently) to get by without saying excuse me / sorry.

# DRIVING TIPS

We only drove in Jeju (best way to get around the island), which was less busy than Seoul or Busan.

* You need an International Driving Permit to drive in Korea
* You cannot turn left on a green light unless you have the green arrow OR you have an unprotected left turn (denoted by a blue sign with white text and white left turn arrow above the lights)
* We did not encounter any stop signs but there were a few intersections with no lights and no stop signs that were stressful and felt like a game of chicken in terms of who had the right of way
* There are lots of roundabouts but it seems no one knows how to use them. We encountered cars trying to enter the roundabout that did not yield to cars in the roundabout, cars in the wrong lane based on where they were trying to exit the roundabout, and several times a car just stopped in the roundabout unsure of what to do.
* They intersperse fake speed bumps among real ones
* There are speed cameras EVERYWHERE. Your car's navigation system will tell you there is a speed camera coming up and what the speed limit is. These notifications are super frequent, sometimes every minute, and they were really distracting. Everyone seemed to be going above the speed limit, so I'm not sure how frequent speeding tickets actually are.
* 95% of cars are a white Hyundai or white Kia
* Parking spots are tiny, make sure to fold in your mirrors when parked
* Lanes are well marked and road signage is super clear

# SHOPPING TIPS

* As mentioned above, bring your passport everywhere and ask if the shop does tax refunds. Some places (e.g. Olive Young, Blue Elephant) will do an immediate tax refund, which means you do not pay the tax. Other places will scan your passport and then you have to scan the receipt at a tax refund kiosk (there are some around Seoul and at the airports) to get the tax refunded back to you. At the airport, you can go to the tax refund counter to get cash back. Some kiosks (e.g. Nike stores) allowed for a refund to your credit card.
* There are 3 Nike stores in Seoul (Myeongdong, Gangnam, Hongdae) where you can customize products. Each store has patches unique to that location. We went to the one in Hongdae. Got there right at opening and there was a small line that was let into the store. It was a super fun experience, we customized caps, tshirts, sweaters, and sweatpants.
   * You can also customize products at Adidas and New Balance, but we didn't visit those stores
* Blue Elephant sells similar sunglasses as Gentle Monster (and they are supposedly made in the same factory as Gentle Monster) for much cheaper. We got sunglasses for ₩47,900/pair.
* Skincare / makeup shopping
   * Olive Young is like Korean Sephora. There are OYs everywhere, but I did most of my shopping at the flagship store in Myeongdong.
   * You can find good deals on skincare at Baviphat, Tem Tem, and All Mask Story in Myeongdong. I read conflicting things on Reddit about the reliability of these discount stores and that there is a risk of getting fake or expired products. I restocked products I regularly use and mostly bought sheet masks. Everything I bought from these places have an expiry date 2-3 years out (typical for skincare) and products seem legit since I'm familiar with the packaging and product appearance / consistency of things I repurchased. HOWEVER, the sales associates are pretty pushy and will tell you they have better prices than OY, which wasn't always true. For example, All Mask Story had 100 Mediheal toner pads for ₩18,500; OY sold a pack of 200 Mediheal toner pads for ₩29,000. All Mask Story sold Lindsay Modeling Mask Packs for ₩2,500; OY had them on sale for ₩500. Other products were similarly priced or slightly more expensive at OY, but at OY you have the peace of mind that all the products are real.
   * Korean pharmacies have great skincare products too! I heard about special pimple patches they sell, but ended up getting the Acnon and Aclean pimple creams and used them throughout my trip. The creams were cheapest in Jeju, most expensive in Myeongdong.",56,Trip Report!,"I also recommend Papago for translation apps, which Korean citizens I have met use often. | I’ll note that Naver maps is better if you can type in the name in Hangul rather than English. Not sure if you were already doing this. 

Also, what did you think of Osulloc? I like their teas but didn’t have time to fit it into my schedule my last trip. | Great recap of an amazing trip. Thanks. Will bookmark it for future use. | Sounds like you had a great time in Korea! Loved the balance between exploring Seoul, Busan, and Jeju. Your shopping and tax refund tips are super handy—definitely helpful for anyone heading there. Also, good call on using **NAVER Maps** instead of Google Maps.

Appreciate the insights, feels like you really made the most of the trip! | Note that the palace is normally closed on Tuesdays. It should've been open since it was a national holiday, but maybe it was added too last minute.

We encountered cars trying to enter the roundabout that did not yield to cars in the roundabout, cars in the wrong lane based on where they were trying to exit the roundabout, and several times a car just stopped in the roundabout unsure of what to do.
* They intersperse fake speed bumps among real ones
* There are speed cameras EVERYWHERE. Your car's navigation system will tell you there is a speed camera coming up and what the speed limit is. These notifications are super frequent, sometimes every minute, and they were really distracting. Everyone seemed to be going above the speed limit, so I'm not sure how frequent speeding tickets actually are.
* 95% of cars are a white Hyundai or white Kia
* Parking spots are tiny, make sure to fold in your mirrors when parked
* Lanes are well marked and road signage is super clear

# SHOPPING TIPS

* As mentioned above, bring your passport everywhere and ask if the shop does tax refunds. Some places (e.g. Olive Young, Blue Elephant) will do an immediate tax refund, which means you do not pay the tax. Other places will scan your passport and then you have to scan the receipt at a tax refund kiosk (there are some around Seoul and at the airports) to get the tax refunded back to you. At the airport, you can go to the tax refund counter to get cash back. Some kiosks (e.g. Nike stores) allowed for a refund to your credit card.
* There are 3 Nike stores in Seoul (Myeongdong, Gangnam, Hongdae) where you can customize products. Each store has patches unique to that location. We went to the one in Hongdae. Got there right at opening and there was a small line that was let into the store. It was a super fun experience, we customized caps, tshirts, sweaters, and sweatpants.
   * You can also customize products at Adidas and New Balance, but we didn't visit those stores
* Blue Elephant sells similar sunglasses as Gentle Monster (and they are supposedly made in the same factory as Gentle Monster) for much cheaper. We got sunglasses for ₩47,900/pair.
* Skincare / makeup shopping
   * Olive Young is like Korean Sephora. There are OYs everywhere, but I did most of my shopping at the flagship store in Myeongdong.
   * You can find good deals on skincare at Baviphat, Tem Tem, and All Mask Story in Myeongdong. I read conflicting things on Reddit about the reliability of these discount stores and that there is a risk of getting fake or expired products. I restocked products I regularly use and mostly bought sheet masks. Everything I bought from these places have an expiry date 2-3 years out (typical for skincare) and products seem legit since I'm familiar with the packaging and product appearance / consistency of things I repurchased. HOWEVER, the sales associates are pretty pushy and will tell you they have better prices than OY, which wasn't always true. For example, All Mask Story had 100 Mediheal toner pads for ₩18,500; OY sold a pack of 200 Mediheal toner pads for ₩29,000. All Mask Story sold Lindsay Modeling Mask Packs for ₩2,500; OY had them on sale for ₩500. Other products were similarly priced or slightly more expensive at OY, but at OY you have the peace of mind that all the products are real.
   * Korean pharmacies have great skincare products too! I heard about special pimple patches they sell, but ended up getting the Acnon and Aclean pimple creams and used them throughout my trip. The creams were cheapest in Jeju, most expensive in Myeongdong. I also recommend Papago for translation apps, which Korean citizens I have met use often. | I’ll note that Naver maps is better if you can type in the name in Hangul rather than English. Not sure if you were already doing this. 

Also, what did you think of Osulloc? I like their teas but didn’t have time to fit it into my schedule my last trip. | Great recap of an amazing trip. Thanks. Will bookmark it for future use. | Sounds like you had a great time in Korea! Loved the balance between exploring Seoul, Busan, and Jeju. Your shopping and tax refund tips are super handy—definitely helpful for anyone heading there. Also, good call on using **NAVER Maps** instead of Google Maps.

Appreciate the insights, feels like you really made the most of the trip! | Note that the palace is normally closed on Tuesdays. It should've been open since it was a national holiday, but maybe it was added too last minute.

After spending a few weeks in Seoul (and loving it!), my Korean friends insisted I should visit Busan... I was doubtful at first (how could it be better than Seoul??) but after spending a week in this wonderful city... I get it now 🥺 Hope you can enjoy the watercolors that inspired this city to me... and here's my full itinerary, if you're curious!    


Feel free to check my [travel videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2bUJZyrxTQ&list=PL9_rKxw1MhrmnunC8m9bUSFmXcjR70coG&index=5&ab_channel=storiesofmilo-silenttravelvlogs%F0%9F%8C%BB) about Busan - hope they can help you plan your trip! ☺️ 

# DAY 1: Gamcheon, Huinyeoul, Biff Square

*   **Gamcheon Cultural Village**
   * tip 1: pass by the [Tourist Information Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KPa2ziiHyoV35WZh8), at the village main entrance, to **get a free map**... *and participate in the* ***Stamp Hunt****!* The map shows you shops/places participating: you can get a nice stamp at each one, and each place has been selected for a reason (historical value, nice view...)
   * tip 2: when everybody agglutinates at the Little Prince statue... Check out this [spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2DLUJiKThjaeGMtv6) - same view, no Prince, but no line to get a nice pic ;) 
   * I also recommend this café with an amazing rooftop view: [Coffee It House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6pqtVeHEj6fx8Lx48)
*  **get the bus to** [**Biff Square**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m4wXWskYZUyqjgfy7) **(20-min)**
   * eat at the square: try Hotteok, a sweet Korean pancake!
   * or eat fresh seafood at [Jagalchi Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/juLUVRdyZnC1zt6w5)
* **get the bus to** [**Jeoryeong Coastal Trail**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GMZXGP4kWcFBeiqs8) **(20-min)**
   * go down to the trail along the beach - [this view](https://youtu.be/-2bUJZyrxTQ?t=653)! breathtaking! 
   * then go up to [Huinyeoul Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QxdpXZht9Yg9i6hM6) - get lost in the tiny alleys of the village! Is this Santorini? I could never get used to [these wonderful sights](https://youtu.be/-2bUJZyrxTQ?t=750)! 
   * I recommend these cafés for amazing views, pictures, coffee and pastries: [The Aether Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J9Vsh24wX8zb8dQN9) and [Huinnyeoul Beach Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5hPEoSnqVmB3bP8eA) 
* **go back to Biff Square at night!** (20-min) It's a whole different atmosphere (way more busy) - I think it's worth experiencing too! And you get to try more Korean street food!

# DAY 2: Haeundae, Blue Train, Songjeong 

* **Explore Haeundae neighborhood!** Lots of cute cafés like [Prahan Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hZz22xMTyLSgrBpB7) (this one is in a cute area with dozens of cool cafés).
* **walk to** [**Mipo station**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JLntjD71GeW8EM9v7)**:** there, you can get the famous Sky capsules or the Blue train. Personally I preferred the [scenic train](https://youtu.be/eRiY8KGvmh8?t=223): much cheaper, more comfortable, better for solo traveler, goes much further than the capsules... Also, the capsules are cool to watch from the outside! Not sure if it's as cool when you're inside. 
* get down at the last station: watch the surfers! swim! check the beautiful Korean [pagoda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M8Gno4UQ24CKRSy4A) by the ocean, walk around [Jukdo park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8DDx7R1ygjT9Pfub9), get a famous toast at [Cafe Moon Toast](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YcSezR2HN81jy3CQ6). Another cool cafés nearby: [Oldmug](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9gfbYN61XsCfhcAw8).
* **walk all the way back to Mipo station! It's a wonderful** [**1-hour walk**](https://youtu.be/eRiY8KGvmh8?t=823)**,** along the ocean until you get in the beautiful forest, watch the sky capsules between the trees, and end up back in Haeundae neighborhood = this walk was in my top 3 moment in Busan!! Try do it around sunset time... The light through the trees is magical! 🥺 
* on the way, **stop at** [**Cheongsapo station**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GsWGozvLMEqkTZ9V9) **to watch the** [**scenic view**](https://youtu.be/eRiY8KGvmh8?t=638)**:** the blue train passing by on the street going down to the ocean... it's worth waiting for a train to pass by! 
* watch the final minutes of sunset from these two spots: [Dalmaji-gil Observation Deck](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PRx7NfzG5D9KiCzG8), then walk down, through a parking, down a few stairs to get a [scenic view](https://youtu.be/eRiY8KGvmh8?t=1050) of the sky capsules on the sunset, with the skyline of Busan in the back... breathtaking! 

# DAY 3: Jeonpo Cafe Street, Gwangalli Beach Drone Show

* this a more ""chill day"" itinerary
* **walk around Jeonpo Cafe Street** for cute cafés, nice shopping, cool neighborhood... Some cafés I enjoyed: [Nogadeulda Nog Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/enfNFPEZBr3SngUc8) (japanese-style, sitting on the floor), [Eternal Sunshine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yRD5gTftt6HEGCzL6) (pancakes to die for), [Your Type Brunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kdirEqEXKXZRL2rQ9) (cute decorations). I also loved this shop: [Paper Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aK9MzcXXqWYkTNr56) - lots of unique items. Check out the [Kyobo bookstore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftoN53tJ755rp7cT8) too for a peaceful atmosphere. 
* In the afternoon, **head to Gwangalli Beach!** Enjoy this cool/beachy neighborhood. Admire the bridge! If you're looking for quiet café to read/draw/chill, I recommend [Café Come and see me](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+come+and+see+me/@35.153506,129.1152834,16.03z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3568edeed9a24bff:0x4377455e36606eaa!8m2!3d35.1534708!4d129.1150565!16s%2Fg%2F11gtgf127c?entry=tts&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDYxNS4wKgBIAVAD). If you want more of a cool vibe, check out [Helmet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DPTf9jJooBroofXU7). 
* **every Saturday, there are two evening times for the drone show at Gwangalli Beach!** 
   * tip 1: try to get to that [spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZRCf716us54Tmhct5) on the beach. At first, when the drones take off, you will think you're in the wrong spot (lots of people will run towards the drones) but actually, the drones will fly to the middle, above the ocean, for everyone to see! It's better to be in the middle, to get a view of the bridge + drone show. 
   * tip 2: towards the end (it lasts 10 minutes), if you're interested to watch the drones come back, walk towards that [spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ofWcWeHHESqPh2ve9). I thought it was cool! Looks like an alien invasion 😂 

I actually spent a week in Busan! I did follow this itinerary, but some days were so perfect (Huinyeoul village, the trail along the ocean from Songjeong to Mipo...) ...I just had to do them more than once 🥺❤️ Feel free to check the [five videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2bUJZyrxTQ&list=PL9_rKxw1MhrmnunC8m9bUSFmXcjR70coG&index=5&ab_channel=storiesofmilo-silenttravelvlogs%F0%9F%8C%BB) I made about my Busan trip if you're curious!

1kqwrap,Cost breakdown of my 10-day trip in Korea (Jeju + Seoul),101,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kqwrap/cost_breakdown_of_my_10day_trip_in_korea_jeju/,1747717125.0,"Felt inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kpy63z/how_much_i_spent_some_notes/) and wanted to share my experience as well.

1. Cost estimates
2. Context for each category
3. Takeaways & Insights + Tips

\+++++

**COST ESTIMATES**

|Category|Cost ($USD / ₩on)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Flights**\*|$795 / \~₩1,125,000|\-$370 off total using CC pts|
|**Accomodations**|$1,475 / \~₩2,085,000|\-$1,000 off total using CC pts|
|**Taxi's**|$180 / ₩252,000|Mainly K-ride, slightly pricier than Uber|
|**Public Transportation**         (T-Money & Climate Card)|$31 - T-Money (₩31,000); Climate Card (₩3,000) + 3-Day Pass (₩10,000)|T-Money includes ₩18,000 airport limo one-way|
|**Day Trips (Jeju) x2**|$140 / \~₩197,000|West/South and East|
|**Beauty/Personal**\*|$2,064 / ₩2,917,000|Color Analysis (₩280,000);  Scalp Spa + Wavy Perm (₩567,000); Micro-blading + Eyeliner (₩550,000); Skin Clinic (₩1,416,000); Gel Mani Nail Art Promo (₩104,000)|
|**Food/Drink**|$540 / ₩762,000||
|**Shopping**\*|$1,700 / ₩2,400|Primarily skincare, then some makeup, jewelry, snacks and other|
|**Misc**|$35 / ₩50,000|Supplies, laundry, random things|

**Context/notes on the above:**

* **Take the beauty/personal and shopping categories with a grain of salt.** My typical shopping spend from previous trips was half the amount and beauty/personal will likely be halved moving forward (will skip color analysis now that I know what I am, likely skip on the scalp spa and visit a less prem skin clinic). Everything else is pretty practical.
* First time in Jeju, been to Seoul several times
* Traveled with another person on/off during this trip; but all costs listed above is just for myself, including taxi's
* I went to Japan afterwards so flight/accomodation costs are limited to only Korea

\+++++

**FLIGHTS**

* **AirPremia - West coast US > ICN - $370** \- great deal and flight with good leg room; further thoughts shared in a [comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kp4s17/comment/msvqu3o/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
* **Korean Air -** Korean Air has a generous checked baggage allowances at 25kg, despite online saying it's 23kg.
   * **GMP > CJU > GMP** \- **$230 -** Prices and flight was as-expected for KA. Could have opted for a budget flight but we didn't want to get nickeled and dimed on everything.
   * **ICN > FUK - $160 -** I don't like purchasing tickets until the last minute so I purchased mine 3 months out. However, 2-3 weeks before the flight, the **price dropped as low as $74.**
      * Flight was 1.5H and they served Paris Baguette sandwiches and gave out extras in the end.
* **EvaAir (not mentioned above) - KIX > TPE > home - $520** \- Good deal, however overweight baggage cost significantly more at 0.5 x cost of extra baggage ($200 USD) = $100 USD
   * KIX > TPE was about 2.5-3hrs and they served a full dinner of tonkatsu curry. Pretty good for a flight short flight.
   * TPE > home had 2 meals - niku-don for 2nd dinner and then chicken porridge for breakfast

**ACCOMODATIONS**

**Incheon - 1N**

* **Accomodation** \- Days Hotel & Suites by Wyndham Incheon Airport
* **Benefit -** Flew in by 8:30PM and needed somewhere to overnight before heading to GMP for a 8:30AM flight to Jeju. Room was spacious and had a kichenette and even laundry machine in the room itself. Located next to Unseo Station which could take the train/subway to GMP or into the city so very convenient. Taxi from ICN was ₩13,500 and a taxi from the hotel to GMP was ₩50,000-₩55,000. If I was traveling solo, I would have opted for taking the train/subway but felt too much responsibility with another person and went with a taxi instead.

**Jeju - 4D / 3N**

* **Accomodation** \- Lotte Jeju City
* **Benefit** \- Central location and was a pick-up point for both my day tours so no need to scramble in the morning. It's a bit far from Old Jeju City but everything you need was within 3-5 mins walking distance (cafes, convenience stores, OY, pharmacies). Taxi to the airport was \~₩5,000-₩7,000.

**Seoul - 6D / 6N**

* **Accomodation** \- Lotte Mapo City
* **Benefit** \- right next to the station, close to several connecting subway lines and just far away enough from being in the chaos of Hongdae, also in front of the airport limo stop (Gongdeok Station)
* **Other thoughts** \- I really loved my room in Jeju but the layout of the Mapo rooms are funky due to the shape of the hotel so on a floor map it literally looks like an ""8."" It's a bit confusing to navigate and the main elevators are on one side of the building. There are other elevators around the building but it's not the clearest - I only found this out when finding my way around the underground mall area. The hotel entrance is also a bit annoying because even though it's literally on the corner of the block, you have to take a detour around the fenced garden/park area in front of the hotel vs going directly from the corner of the block to the door.

\+++++

**TAXI'S**

* For Jeju, we mainly taxi'ed around as neither of us wanted to rent a car or could drive.
   * Day 1 - spent \~₩100,000 on taxi's. It was \~₩5,000 from the airport to hote, then \~₩45,000 to Seongwipo, \~₩8,000 to a cafe and then another \~₩45,000 back to Jeju City.
   * Day 2 and 3 were covered by our day trips (south/west and east) so we really spent ₩20,000 each day to go to dinner and back
   * Day 4 - spent \~₩70,000 - this was more of a me-problem because I wanted to explore the north side on my own. You can save money opting for public transit or just not doing this at all. I went to Gawkji Beach and walked to Haejigae Cafe, took a taxi to the Iho Lighthouses before taxing to Dongmum Market and back to my hotel to catch my flight.
* For Seoul - We Ubered from GMP to the hotel which wasn't too bad (₩21,000) and probably taxi'ed 2-3 other times when we were too exhausted to sit in the subway for 1hr to get back to our hotels in the evening.
* **App of choice - K-Ride -** From my experience there are 2 foreigner-friendly taxi apps: (1) k-ride and (2) Uber. Someone fact-check me on this:
   * **Uber Taxi** (available March 2024) - you can use your existing Uber account for this and works as-is. They have the economy taxi which are the orange taxi's you see out and about so they are ever so slightly cheaper. I only took Uber once from GMP to ur hotel because I wasn't sure if k-ride shared the same pick-up zone as Uber and I found Uber's right away.
   * **K-ride** (available mid-to-late 2024) - lowest rates start with the standard option (no economy orange taxi's). The price difference felt negligible ranigng from ₩1,000-₩8,000 depending on total cost. Think of it as maybe a 10% uptick on Uber. So a ride that would cost ₩5000 could be ₩5,500.
   * Taxi drivers, to my understanding, can use multiple taxi apps and will accept whichever comes through first (some taxi's had multiple app labels on their cars). I can't speak for Uber but for k-ride, they will see a customer requesting a ride from the k-ride app. Although it doesn't explicitly indicate that the passenger is a foreigner, they can make that conclusion since the app is geared towards foreigners. In all of my rides, they were all very friendly and might have spoken a few words of English. Whereas my past experience with KakaoTaxi were horrendous with many mean drivers (maybe they were expecting a local passenger only to get a foreigner). On top of that, it could also be that the taxi's are standard ""tiers"" vs the economy so maybe they provide better customer service. We've had a couple drivers who would circle around the block to make sure you get off on the correct side of the street too - I would just tell them I can cross myself but they'll just go the extra mile. This is also why I'm willing to pay that 10% upcharge, given all the PTSD I've experience from a past visit to Busan.

\+++++

**PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION**

* **Climate Card (Seoul)** \- See [website ](https://english.seoul.go.kr/policy/transportation/climate-card/)for day pass prices. The **card cost ₩3,000** from a convenience store but you need to purchase the pass to add into the card from a subway station. I will do the math for you on whether it's worth it or not. For example:
   * ₩3,000 (card) + ₩15,000 (5-day pass) = ₩18,000 / (₩1,400 subways or ₩1,500 longer-distance subways or buses) = \~12-13 rides over 5-day period (or \~3 rides/day) to break even. It's easy to break even if you take the subway to-and-from your hotel + 1 more ride inbetween.
   * For context, I rode public transit 5-6 times but didn't have the day passes so I incurred ₩8,400 on that day alone.
* **Airport Limo (Seoul) - ₩18,000 paid with T-Money card**. If you are near one of the one of the stops, it's totally worth it. The express one is ₩18,000 while there's another 2 lines that make a few more stops for ₩17,000. The driver is super friendly, load and unloads your luggage for you - I hope he gets paid well. I took the first one that arrived at my station at 4:30AM and it was already half-full! Luckily everyone from the last stop fit on the bus and we all made it to the airport. From my station, it took exactly 1 hour so I arrived at 5:30AM.

\+++++

**DAY TRIPS IN JEJU** \- [See my comment here for deets](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kjwao1/comment/mrtgya3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

TLDR I booked my trips via Klook. You either like Klook or hate it - I won't judge you. I've personally purchased from them numerous times over the years on previous trips and never had any issues.

\+++++

**BEAUTY / PERSONAL SERVICES** \- [See full thoughts in a separate post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kdpwlm/treated_myself_to_color_analysis_scalp_spa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Planning to go to another clinic on my next visit to Korea so I have something to compare with.

\+++++

**FOOD / DRINK** \- mix of solo dining and dining with another person and also mix of pricier and cheaper restaurants. I did not dine out of convenience stores during this trip. To list a few:

* **Jeju**
   * **Kihoe 기회횟집 (Old Jeju City - solo prob OK if you can eat it all)** \- one of the best seafood restaraunts with the freshest mackerel sashimi I've ever head. They also have what looks like raw langoustine tails - it looks like a mini lobster but taste like shrimp. Both were amazing and I would highly recommend! The staff were super friendly too. They only have 2-portion servings but I was able to finish everything on my own.
   * **Café Gyukkot Darak 카페 귤꽃다락 (Jeju South)** \- cute aesthetic cafe. Recommendations - tangarine latte and green tangarine ade.
   * **Haejigae Café 해지개 (Jeju North)** \- another cute cafe with so many pastries... I wish I could eate it all.
   * **Tangerine Mochi - Seongwipo Ollie Market (Jeju)** \- some of the sweetest/juiciest tangarines ever
   * Some flops:
      * **Black Jeju Pork BBQ** \- it wasn't as impressive as I thought. I had stirfry Black Jeju Pork and it tasted better.
      * We had a seafood stew in Seongwipo which looked amazing and had at least 10 abalone in the pot. The abalone and soup was the best part, followed by the squid/octopus, crab/shrimp was okay but all the clams had sand in it so you can imagine how it ruined the dish.
* **Seoul**
   * **Solsot 솔솥 (multiple locations, solo OK)** \- hot pot rice - good comfort food and located everywhere!
   * **Sinsa Kkotgedang Apgujeong Rodeo Ganjang Gejang 신사꽃게당 강남 압구정로데오점 간장게장 전문 (solo OK)** \- marinated crab - first time having it and was so nervous about it we almost aborted. It's one of the pricier meals we had at ₩125,000/2 people. It was amazing. My preference was soy marinated because the spicy one started getting too salty later on. The crab stew was equally amazing although the meat was pretty much overcooked by the time we tried to eat it and all the flavor got extracted into the soup. Dispense the raw crab into your rice, mix with seaweed and sesame oil and it's heavenly.
   * **Kyoja Myeongdong** **(solo OK)** \- classic option and I come here at least once every time I visit Seoul. You can tecnically get so many freebies for free, too. The stranger sitting across from me got an order of kalgusku + bowl of extra noodles + bowl of extra soup + 2 bowls of rice and emptied out the kimchi bin. Clearly this wasn't her first time.
   * **Woo-Jin 우진유통** **(Majang Meat Market) (solo prob OK)** \- really fresh and high quality hanwoo. The staff were super friendly and even gave us yukhoe meat for free. The restaurant they took us to charged ₩5,000 to prepare the yukhoe and although it was a pretty basic preparation, it was good enough for me! Back at home the same dish would cost anywhere from $23-$33. Highly recommend and would come back. If you want to dine solo, you will need to order cuts individually vs the prepackaged sets because they're pretty hefty. They recommend 200-300g of meat per person.
   * **Hongojip** **혼고집 (Hongdae - solo OK)** \- solo KBBQ restaurant - love the concept and the staff were friendly. A lot of their popular sets were sold out by the time I showed up around 7:30PM. Quality was decent and I was mostly happy to have solo BBQ.
   * **Jayeondo Sogeumppang Dosan 자연도소금빵** **(multiple locations)** \- THAT salt bread place and it lives up to the hype. It is sucky that you have to order a set of 4 buns because if you don't eat it within the first 2 days, it starts to get stale. Just thinking about it gets me all jittery.
   * Other places:
      * **Onion Cafe** \- went here 2 years ago and waited almost 90 mins to get a table. It was good but I wouldn't want to wait that long ever again. We lucked out with the Pandoro because it was not always available and they brought it out right as we were picking our bread.
      * **Standard Bread** \- showed up when they opened and there was already a 30-party waitlist so I opted for takeaway which was instant. Good thing about the dine-in waitlist was that you can download the CatchTable app and add your name to the waitlist. HOWEVER, it doesn't come up on the search so you have to scan the QR code in person (unless you save the URL) to add your name to the waitlist. Some of the bread loaves came in 1/2 sizes thankfully. The tissue bread wasn't anything special... it felt more like a gimmick. The salt bread was good and had butter in the center, although I prefer Jayeondo Sogeumppang's buns to a bread loaf texture. The rust bread was the winner - it was basically a slice of bread that had a fully carmelized shell.

\+++++

**SHOPPING** \- Full honesty, this was overkill. In prior trips, I'd spend half that amount. Part of this had to do with the tariff situation in the States and the lack thereof sunscreens and some products were for friends/family. I found out 95% of my makeup was completely wrong (I owned all warm toned makeup when I had cool-toned skin) so I had to purchase some new products. Did a ton of research and all the products purchased were at least 30-50% cheaper than buying in the States. 

* 75% skincare
* 10% makeup
* 8% jewelry/accessories
* 7% snacks/food + misc. (most of my snack purchases were made in Japan)
   * I liked the face masks from Korea (not sheet mask, but the ones to cover your mouth/nose). They are bigger than the ones in Japan and I wish I bought more because I ran out and had to buy some in Japan and they weren't the same.

I don't know if other's are experiencing this, but Olive Young doesn't seem to be giving out samples/freebies anymore. I did a few hauls and the one time I asked for something, they gave me 10 cotton pads. On the other hand, the actual brick and mortar brands and even AmoreMall gives out so many sample/freebies.

\+++++

**TAKEAWAYS & INSIGHTS + TIPS**

* **International Credit Card** and/or **International Debit Card** to avoid the extra fees. No more are the days of purchasing foreign currency in advance and getting charged for the transaction (domestically). Do double-check that the ATM/Banks at your destination accepts your debit card.
   * Total cash on-hand during the trip (includes ATM withdrawals) \~ ₩960,000. Minus color analysis (₩280,000), brow/eyeliner service (₩450,000) and gel mani (₩74,000) = **\~₩156,000 randomly on laundry, tips for day trips, restaurants, etc.**
* **Bookings** \- Compared to Japan, I don't think we booked that many reservations for restaurants. We had 2 that fell through due to timing and were able to walk-in for most of the other places. Do book for services as soon as possible because certain popular places can get booked up quickly so make sure to follow them on socials for updates.
* **Google Maps + Naver/Taxi Apps works hand-in-hand -** We all know Google Maps doesn't work well in Korea, but it doesn't mean it's completely useless. Even though Naver/taxi apps has English, many of the destinations will not come up in the search. For the most part, your destination will come up on Google Maps and you can copy the Korean name from the app and paste into Naver/k-ride and the results will show up.
   * Ahead of your trip, if you know you're going to hail a taxi realtime (vs using an app), make sure you have the **Korean name/address written down** on a notepad so you can hand it over to the driver. Otherwise, showing them a pin on a map won't do you much good. They start the meter right as you enter the car so time spent looking up the address will eat into your meter.
* **Google Translator -** I know a lot of people say ""Papago is the way to go,"" but I didn't like the interface of the camera translation. I never found myself needing to converse so I really didn't need Papago. I know some basic Korean so even if Google Translate was incorrect, it gave me a general idea of what I was looking for and it was enough for me to take it from there.
* **Seoul Airport Limo** \- If you have a 7:30AM flight like I did, which boards at 6:50AM-7AM, I wouldn't recommend taking this unless you like to gamble cutting it close. On this weekday, security was extremely congested, taking 1 hour alone (not including bag drop, immigration/border, going to the gate). By the time I got to the gate it was 6:55AM and boarding started at 6:50AM. My original flight time was at 8AM but moved up to 7:30AM.
* **Incheon SmartPass = flop** \- I didn't think I needed it so I never set it up until I had to deal with the 1-hour long security line. The SmartPass line still had quite a number of people but I tried setting it up while I was in the standard line. I got past the face scanning and NFC scanning but ran into the same error after numerous attempts on the passport data entry portion. Maybe my face was too bruised from the skin clinic to confirm it's me? Who knows. Does anyone have insight on this?
* **Airport Tax Refund via Cash** \- The kiosks operate pretty much 24/7, **HOWEVER cash refund portion is only available from 7AM until 7or 9PM** (I didn't look closely enough). Not sure if this has to do with exchange rates in the market but my flight started boarding at 6:50AM and I was a solid 10-15mins walking distance from the machine to the gate so I didn't want to risk it. The machines are immediately after security so it's very easy to spot. They do offer other payment methods like Ali-pay and 2 other options but I didn't have those payment methods. I lost out on ₩27,000 refund...which realizing now I could have taken advantage of the flight delay at Jeju Airport and gotten back at least ₩10,000.
* **Russian doll your suitcases/bags** \- not anything new but my original plan was to pack clothes in my carry-on suitcase and stuff it in my medium suitcase. I ended up packing 95% of my capsule wardrobe in a **30L Bellroy Lite Travel Bag** instead, which fit in the carry-on and then in the medium so I ended up with 2 empty suitcases for shopping purposes. All my Korea shopping fit in my carry-on and came in at around 19kg. My medium suitcase was designated for Japan (ya'll know Japan goes way too hard on their packaging game).
   * I got the Bellroy Lite on a whim during a BF sale as a means to replace my personal item backpack. Yes I know it's huge for a personal item but this [Redditor's photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1f62ukv/comment/lkzt0fv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) told me otherwise. Technically speaking, I never subjected this to be a personal item during my trip but it was my carry-on for the most part. This bag never ceases to amaze me because it keeps on giving, even when you think you've stuffed it way too much.
* **Unbox all your goods to save space** \- If you really want to keep the boxes, flatten it and put it in the back of your suitcase. Keep boxes for only for products that are fragile like glass and have flimsy lids that run the risk of popping off during transit/pressure. Some examples:
   * I got a glass jar of Osulloc green tea milk spread a few years back and it exploded in my luggage when I got home. Unfortunately it didn't come in a box regardless.
   * HBAF assorted almond packs - took all the small bags out and popped them into every crevice to act as padding for products. They're almonds - they won't get crushed. Upon arrival, I just re-bag it in its original bag.
   * Be aware that you may run the **risk of getttng an overweight suitcase** because now you can store way more items in your suitcase.
* **Luggage scale** \- came in cluch on many occasions. Towards the end of my Japan leg, I thought I had to pay for an overweight suitcase but got it resolved and they came in under the limit.",39,Trip Report,"What an amazing breakdown - you’ve put so much effort into it! Thanks a lot! Saved! | 230USD for a return to Jeju is nuts btw lol. You can frequently get flights 15 USD each way. I paid abt 50USD return cuz i wanted to take specific airlines each way) but would have otherwise paid 30USD return for the cheapest tickets.

Low Cost Carriers get a bad rep in the west but I flew on Air Busan, Air Seoul and Jeju Air and they was nothing different other than the fact they were super strict on electric batteries (due to numerous fire incidents). They were functionally the same for a domestic hour hop. There was no nickel and diming, with baggage allowances being (relatively) more generous than their European counterparts.  | You should go to Busan and Gyeongju | This is amazing! 
I honestly think Tmoney is the easiest way to go. 
And Google Maps actually works fine if you want to use it for short distance or seeing reviews. 

Funny enough I actually use CHATGPT a lot to ask about how to go somewhere when they’re too many options to choose from and ChatGPT always give the best route. | Thanks for sharing","Cost breakdown of my 10-day trip in Korea (Jeju + Seoul) Felt inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kpy63z/how_much_i_spent_some_notes/) and wanted to share my experience as well.

1. Cost estimates
2. Context for each category
3. Takeaways & Insights + Tips

\+++++

**COST ESTIMATES**

|Category|Cost ($USD / ₩on)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Flights**\*|$795 / \~₩1,125,000|\-$370 off total using CC pts|
|**Accomodations**|$1,475 / \~₩2,085,000|\-$1,000 off total using CC pts|
|**Taxi's**|$180 / ₩252,000|Mainly K-ride, slightly pricier than Uber|
|**Public Transportation**         (T-Money & Climate Card)|$31 - T-Money (₩31,000); Climate Card (₩3,000) + 3-Day Pass (₩10,000)|T-Money includes ₩18,000 airport limo one-way|
|**Day Trips (Jeju) x2**|$140 / \~₩197,000|West/South and East|
|**Beauty/Personal**\*|$2,064 / ₩2,917,000|Color Analysis (₩280,000);  Scalp Spa + Wavy Perm (₩567,000); Micro-blading + Eyeliner (₩550,000); Skin Clinic (₩1,416,000); Gel Mani Nail Art Promo (₩104,000)|

|**Shopping**\*|$1,700 / ₩2,400|Primarily skincare, then some makeup, jewelry, snacks and other|
|**Misc**|$35 / ₩50,000|Supplies, laundry, random things|

**Context/notes on the above:**

* **Take the beauty/personal and shopping categories with a grain of salt.** My typical shopping spend from previous trips was half the amount and beauty/personal will likely be halved moving forward (will skip color analysis now that I know what I am, likely skip on the scalp spa and visit a less prem skin clinic). Everything else is pretty practical.
* First time in Jeju, been to Seoul several times
* Traveled with another person on/off during this trip; but all costs listed above is just for myself, including taxi's
* I went to Japan afterwards so flight/accomodation costs are limited to only Korea

\+++++

**FLIGHTS**

* **AirPremia - West coast US > ICN - $370** \- great deal and flight with good leg room; further thoughts shared in a [comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kp4s17/comment/msvqu3o/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
* **Korean Air -** Korean Air has a generous checked baggage allowances at 25kg, despite online saying it's 23kg.
   * **GMP > CJU > GMP** \- **$230 -** Prices and flight was as-expected for KA. Could have opted for a budget flight but we didn't want to get nickeled and dimed on everything.
   * **ICN > FUK - $160 -** I don't like purchasing tickets until the last minute so I purchased mine 3 months out. However, 2-3 weeks before the flight, the **price dropped as low as $74.**
      * Flight was 1.5H and they served Paris Baguette sandwiches and gave out extras in the end.
* **EvaAir (not mentioned above) - KIX > TPE > home - $520** \- Good deal, however overweight baggage cost significantly more at 0.5 x cost of extra baggage ($200 USD) = $100 USD
   * KIX > TPE was about 2.5-3hrs and they served a full dinner of tonkatsu curry. Pretty good for a flight short flight.
   * TPE > home had 2 meals - niku-don for 2nd dinner and then chicken porridge for breakfast

\+++++

**ACCOMODATIONS**

**Incheon - 1N**

* **Accomodation** \- Days Hotel & Suites by Wyndham Incheon Airport
* **Benefit -** Flew in by 8:30PM and needed somewhere to overnight before heading to GMP for a 8:30AM flight to Jeju. Room was spacious and had a kichenette and even laundry machine in the room itself. Located next to Unseo Station which could take the train/subway to GMP or into the city so very convenient. Taxi from ICN was ₩13,500 and a taxi from the hotel to GMP was ₩50,000-₩55,000. If I was traveling solo, I would have opted for taking the train/subway but felt too much responsibility with another person and went with a taxi instead.

**Jeju - 4D / 3N**

* **Accomodation** \- Lotte Jeju City
* **Benefit** \- Central location and was a pick-up point for both my day tours so no need to scramble in the morning. It's a bit far from Old Jeju City but everything you need was within 3-5 mins walking distance (cafes, convenience stores, OY, pharmacies). Taxi to the airport was \~₩5,000-₩7,000.

**Seoul - 6D / 6N**

* **Accomodation** \- Lotte Mapo City
* **Benefit** \- right next to the station, close to several connecting subway lines and just far away enough from being in the chaos of Hongdae, also in front of the airport limo stop (Gongdeok Station)
* **Other thoughts** \- I really loved my room in Jeju but the layout of the Mapo rooms are funky due to the shape of the hotel so on a floor map it literally looks like an ""8."" It's a bit confusing to navigate and the main elevators are on one side of the building. There are other elevators around the building but it's not the clearest - I only found this out when finding my way around the underground mall area. The hotel entrance is also a bit annoying because even though it's literally on the corner of the block, you have to take a detour around the fenced garden/park area in front of the hotel vs going directly from the corner of the block to the door.

**TAXI'S**

* For Jeju, we mainly taxi'ed around as neither of us wanted to rent a car or could drive.
   * Day 1 - spent \~₩100,000 on taxi's. It was \~₩5,000 from the airport to hote, then \~₩45,000 to Seongwipo, \~₩8,000 to a cafe and then another \~₩45,000 back to Jeju City.
   * Day 2 and 3 were covered by our day trips (south/west and east) so we really spent ₩20,000 each day to go to dinner and back
   * Day 4 - spent \~₩70,000 - this was more of a me-problem because I wanted to explore the north side on my own. You can save money opting for public transit or just not doing this at all. I went to Gawkji Beach and walked to Haejigae Cafe, took a taxi to the Iho Lighthouses before taxing to Dongmum Market and back to my hotel to catch my flight.
* For Seoul - We Ubered from GMP to the hotel which wasn't too bad (₩21,000) and probably taxi'ed 2-3 other times when we were too exhausted to sit in the subway for 1hr to get back to our hotels in the evening.
* **App of choice - K-Ride -** From my experience there are 2 foreigner-friendly taxi apps: (1) k-ride and (2) Uber. Someone fact-check me on this:
   * **Uber Taxi** (available March 2024) - you can use your existing Uber account for this and works as-is. They have the economy taxi which are the orange taxi's you see out and about so they are ever so slightly cheaper. I only took Uber once from GMP to ur hotel because I wasn't sure if k-ride shared the same pick-up zone as Uber and I found Uber's right away.
   * **K-ride** (available mid-to-late 2024) - lowest rates start with the standard option (no economy orange taxi's). The price difference felt negligible ranigng from ₩1,000-₩8,000 depending on total cost. Think of it as maybe a 10% uptick on Uber. So a ride that would cost ₩5000 could be ₩5,500.
   * Taxi drivers, to my understanding, can use multiple taxi apps and will accept whichever comes through first (some taxi's had multiple app labels on their cars). I can't speak for Uber but for k-ride, they will see a customer requesting a ride from the k-ride app. Although it doesn't explicitly indicate that the passenger is a foreigner, they can make that conclusion since the app is geared towards foreigners. In all of my rides, they were all very friendly and might have spoken a few words of English. Whereas my past experience with KakaoTaxi were horrendous with many mean drivers (maybe they were expecting a local passenger only to get a foreigner). On top of that, it could also be that the taxi's are standard ""tiers"" vs the economy so maybe they provide better customer service. We've had a couple drivers who would circle around the block to make sure you get off on the correct side of the street too - I would just tell them I can cross myself but they'll just go the extra mile. This is also why I'm willing to pay that 10% upcharge, given all the PTSD I've experience from a past visit to Busan.

**PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION**

* **Climate Card (Seoul)** \- See [website ](https://english.seoul.go.kr/policy/transportation/climate-card/)for day pass prices. The **card cost ₩3,000** from a convenience store but you need to purchase the pass to add into the card from a subway station. I will do the math for you on whether it's worth it or not. For example:
   * ₩3,000 (card) + ₩15,000 (5-day pass) = ₩18,000 / (₩1,400 subways or ₩1,500 longer-distance subways or buses) = \~12-13 rides over 5-day period (or \~3 rides/day) to break even. It's easy to break even if you take the subway to-and-from your hotel + 1 more ride inbetween.
   * For context, I rode public transit 5-6 times but didn't have the day passes so I incurred ₩8,400 on that day alone.
* **Airport Limo (Seoul) - ₩18,000 paid with T-Money card**. If you are near one of the one of the stops, it's totally worth it. The express one is ₩18,000 while there's another 2 lines that make a few more stops for ₩17,000. The driver is super friendly, load and unloads your luggage for you - I hope he gets paid well. I took the first one that arrived at my station at 4:30AM and it was already half-full! Luckily everyone from the last stop fit on the bus and we all made it to the airport. From my station, it took exactly 1 hour so I arrived at 5:30AM.

**DAY TRIPS IN JEJU** \- [See my comment here for deets](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kjwao1/comment/mrtgya3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

TLDR I booked my trips via Klook. You either like Klook or hate it - I won't judge you. I've personally purchased from them numerous times over the years on previous trips and never had any issues.

\+++++

**BEAUTY / PERSONAL SERVICES** \- [See full thoughts in a separate post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1kdpwlm/treated_myself_to_color_analysis_scalp_spa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Planning to go to another clinic on my next visit to Korea so I have something to compare with.

\+++++

**FOOD / DRINK** \- mix of solo dining and dining with another person and also mix of pricier and cheaper restaurants. I did not dine out of convenience stores during this trip. To list a few:

* **Jeju**
   * **Kihoe 기회횟집 (Old Jeju City - solo prob OK if you can eat it all)** \- one of the best seafood restaraunts with the freshest mackerel sashimi I've ever head. They also have what looks like raw langoustine tails - it looks like a mini lobster but taste like shrimp. Both were amazing and I would highly recommend! The staff were super friendly too. They only have 2-portion servings but I was able to finish everything on my own.
   * **Café Gyukkot Darak 카페 귤꽃다락 (Jeju South)** \- cute aesthetic cafe. Recommendations - tangarine latte and green tangarine ade.
   * **Haejigae Café 해지개 (Jeju North)** \- another cute cafe with so many pastries... I wish I could eate it all.
   * **Tangerine Mochi - Seongwipo Ollie Market (Jeju)** \- some of the sweetest/juiciest tangarines ever
   * Some flops:
      * **Black Jeju Pork BBQ** \- it wasn't as impressive as I thought. I had stirfry Black Jeju Pork and it tasted better.
      * We had a seafood stew in Seongwipo which looked amazing and had at least 10 abalone in the pot. The abalone and soup was the best part, followed by the squid/octopus, crab/shrimp was okay but all the clams had sand in it so you can imagine how it ruined the dish.
* **Seoul**
   * **Solsot 솔솥 (multiple locations, solo OK)** \- hot pot rice - good comfort food and located everywhere!
   * **Sinsa Kkotgedang Apgujeong Rodeo Ganjang Gejang 신사꽃게당 강남 압구정로데오점 간장게장 전문 (solo OK)** \- marinated crab - first time having it and was so nervous about it we almost aborted. It's one of the pricier meals we had at ₩125,000/2 people. It was amazing. My preference was soy marinated because the spicy one started getting too salty later on. The crab stew was equally amazing although the meat was pretty much overcooked by the time we tried to eat it and all the flavor got extracted into the soup. Dispense the raw crab into your rice, mix with seaweed and sesame oil and it's heavenly.
   * **Kyoja Myeongdong** **(solo OK)** \- classic option and I come here at least once every time I visit Seoul. You can tecnically get so many freebies for free, too. The stranger sitting across from me got an order of kalgusku + bowl of extra noodles + bowl of extra soup + 2 bowls of rice and emptied out the kimchi bin. Clearly this wasn't her first time.
   * **Woo-Jin 우진유통** **(Majang Meat Market) (solo prob OK)** \- really fresh and high quality hanwoo. The staff were super friendly and even gave us yukhoe meat for free. The restaurant they took us to charged ₩5,000 to prepare the yukhoe and although it was a pretty basic preparation, it was good enough for me! Back at home the same dish would cost anywhere from $23-$33. Highly recommend and would come back. If you want to dine solo, you will need to order cuts individually vs the prepackaged sets because they're pretty hefty. They recommend 200-300g of meat per person.
   * **Hongojip** **혼고집 (Hongdae - solo OK)** \- solo KBBQ restaurant - love the concept and the staff were friendly. A lot of their popular sets were sold out by the time I showed up around 7:30PM. Quality was decent and I was mostly happy to have solo BBQ.
   * **Jayeondo Sogeumppang Dosan 자연도소금빵** **(multiple locations)** \- THAT salt bread place and it lives up to the hype. It is sucky that you have to order a set of 4 buns because if you don't eat it within the first 2 days, it starts to get stale. Just thinking about it gets me all jittery.
   * Other places:
      * **Onion Cafe** \- went here 2 years ago and waited almost 90 mins to get a table. It was good but I wouldn't want to wait that long ever again. We lucked out with the Pandoro because it was not always available and they brought it out right as we were picking our bread.
      * **Standard Bread** \- showed up when they opened and there was already a 30-party waitlist so I opted for takeaway which was instant. Good thing about the dine-in waitlist was that you can download the CatchTable app and add your name to the waitlist. HOWEVER, it doesn't come up on the search so you have to scan the QR code in person (unless you save the URL) to add your name to the waitlist. Some of the bread loaves came in 1/2 sizes thankfully. The tissue bread wasn't anything special... it felt more like a gimmick. The salt bread was good and had butter in the center, although I prefer Jayeondo Sogeumppang's buns to a bread loaf texture. The rust bread was the winner - it was basically a slice of bread that had a fully carmelized shell.

\+++++

**SHOPPING** \- Full honesty, this was overkill. In prior trips, I'd spend half that amount. Part of this had to do with the tariff situation in the States and the lack thereof sunscreens and some products were for friends/family. I found out 95% of my makeup was completely wrong (I owned all warm toned makeup when I had cool-toned skin) so I had to purchase some new products. Did a ton of research and all the products purchased were at least 30-50% cheaper than buying in the States. 

* 75% skincare
* 10% makeup
* 8% jewelry/accessories
* 7% snacks/food + misc. (most of my snack purchases were made in Japan)
   * I liked the face masks from Korea (not sheet mask, but the ones to cover your mouth/nose). They are bigger than the ones in Japan and I wish I bought more because I ran out and had to buy some in Japan and they weren't the same.

I don't know if other's are experiencing this, but Olive Young doesn't seem to be giving out samples/freebies anymore. I did a few hauls and the one time I asked for something, they gave me 10 cotton pads. On the other hand, the actual brick and mortar brands and even AmoreMall gives out so many sample/freebies.

\+++++

**TAKEAWAYS & INSIGHTS + TIPS**

* **International Credit Card** and/or **International Debit Card** to avoid the extra fees. No more are the days of purchasing foreign currency in advance and getting charged for the transaction (domestically). Do double-check that the ATM/Banks at your destination accepts your debit card.
   * Total cash on-hand during the trip (includes ATM withdrawals) \~ ₩960,000. Minus color analysis (₩280,000), brow/eyeliner service (₩450,000) and gel mani (₩74,000) = **\~₩156,000 randomly on laundry, tips for day trips, restaurants, etc.**
* **Bookings** \- Compared to Japan, I don't think we booked that many reservations for restaurants. We had 2 that fell through due to timing and were able to walk-in for most of the other places. Do book for services as soon as possible because certain popular places can get booked up quickly so make sure to follow them on socials for updates.
* **Google Maps + Naver/Taxi Apps works hand-in-hand -** We all know Google Maps doesn't work well in Korea, but it doesn't mean it's completely useless. Even though Naver/taxi apps has English, many of the destinations will not come up in the search. For the most part, your destination will come up on Google Maps and you can copy the Korean name from the app and paste into Naver/k-ride and the results will show up.
   * Ahead of your trip, if you know you're going to hail a taxi realtime (vs using an app), make sure you have the **Korean name/address written down** on a notepad so you can hand it over to the driver. Otherwise, showing them a pin on a map won't do you much good. They start the meter right as you enter the car so time spent looking up the address will eat into your meter.
* **Google Translator -** I know a lot of people say ""Papago is the way to go,"" but I didn't like the interface of the camera translation. I never found myself needing to converse so I really didn't need Papago. I know some basic Korean so even if Google Translate was incorrect, it gave me a general idea of what I was looking for and it was enough for me to take it from there.
* **Seoul Airport Limo** \- If you have a 7:30AM flight like I did, which boards at 6:50AM-7AM, I wouldn't recommend taking this unless you like to gamble cutting it close. On this weekday, security was extremely congested, taking 1 hour alone (not including bag drop, immigration/border, going to the gate). By the time I got to the gate it was 6:55AM and boarding started at 6:50AM. My original flight time was at 8AM but moved up to 7:30AM.
* **Incheon SmartPass = flop** \- I didn't think I needed it so I never set it up until I had to deal with the 1-hour long security line. The SmartPass line still had quite a number of people but I tried setting it up while I was in the standard line. I got past the face scanning and NFC scanning but ran into the same error after numerous attempts on the passport data entry portion. Maybe my face was too bruised from the skin clinic to confirm it's me? Who knows. Does anyone have insight on this?
* **Airport Tax Refund via Cash** \- The kiosks operate pretty much 24/7, **HOWEVER cash refund portion is only available from 7AM until 7or 9PM** (I didn't look closely enough). Not sure if this has to do with exchange rates in the market but my flight started boarding at 6:50AM and I was a solid 10-15mins walking distance from the machine to the gate so I didn't want to risk it. The machines are immediately after security so it's very easy to spot. They do offer other payment methods like Ali-pay and 2 other options but I didn't have those payment methods. I lost out on ₩27,000 refund...which realizing now I could have taken advantage of the flight delay at Jeju Airport and gotten back at least ₩10,000.
* **Russian doll your suitcases/bags** \- not anything new but my original plan was to pack clothes in my carry-on suitcase and stuff it in my medium suitcase. I ended up packing 95% of my capsule wardrobe in a **30L Bellroy Lite Travel Bag** instead, which fit in the carry-on and then in the medium so I ended up with 2 empty suitcases for shopping purposes. All my Korea shopping fit in my carry-on and came in at around 19kg. My medium suitcase was designated for Japan (ya'll know Japan goes way too hard on their packaging game).
   * I got the Bellroy Lite on a whim during a BF sale as a means to replace my personal item backpack. Yes I know it's huge for a personal item but this [Redditor's photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1f62ukv/comment/lkzt0fv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) told me otherwise. Technically speaking, I never subjected this to be a personal item during my trip but it was my carry-on for the most part. This bag never ceases to amaze me because it keeps on giving, even when you think you've stuffed it way too much.
* **Unbox all your goods to save space** \- If you really want to keep the boxes, flatten it and put it in the back of your suitcase. Keep boxes for only for products that are fragile like glass and have flimsy lids that run the risk of popping off during transit/pressure. Some examples:
   * I got a glass jar of Osulloc green tea milk spread a few years back and it exploded in my luggage when I got home. Unfortunately it didn't come in a box regardless.
   * HBAF assorted almond packs - took all the small bags out and popped them into every crevice to act as padding for products. They're almonds - they won't get crushed. Upon arrival, I just re-bag it in its original bag.
   * Be aware that you may run the **risk of getttng an overweight suitcase** because now you can store way more items in your suitcase.
* **Luggage scale** \- came in cluch on many occasions. Towards the end of my Japan leg, I thought I had to pay for an overweight suitcase but got it resolved and they came in under the limit. What an amazing breakdown - you’ve put so much effort into it! Thanks a lot! Saved! | 230USD for a return to Jeju is nuts btw lol. You can frequently get flights 15 USD each way. I paid abt 50USD return cuz i wanted to take specific airlines each way) but would have otherwise paid 30USD return for the cheapest tickets.

Low Cost Carriers get a bad rep in the west but I flew on Air Busan, Air Seoul and Jeju Air and they was nothing different other than the fact they were super strict on electric batteries (due to numerous fire incidents). They were functionally the same for a domestic hour hop. There was no nickel and diming, with baggage allowances being (relatively) more generous than their European counterparts.  | You should go to Busan and Gyeongju | This is amazing! 
I honestly think Tmoney is the easiest way to go. 
And Google Maps actually works fine if you want to use it for short distance or seeing reviews. 

Funny enough I actually use CHATGPT a lot to ask about how to go somewhere when they’re too many options to choose from and ChatGPT always give the best route. | Thanks for sharing"

1klv1kt,Reflections on 7 days in Korea,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1klv1kt/reflections_on_7_days_in_korea/,1747164658.0,"See accompanying photos: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Resident\_Rain\_4350/comments/1kluy31/reflections\_on\_7\_days\_in\_korea\_accompanying\_images/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Resident_Rain_4350/comments/1kluy31/reflections_on_7_days_in_korea_accompanying_images/)

  
This is a reflection and summary of time spent during an unforgettable whirlwind weeklong trip. For context, we are two half-Korean, 30-something, female, American surgical residents. My friend’s parents joined. Writer (me) is proudly queer and culturally somewhat Korean (e.g. knows how to cook mid-level Korean food), and—less proudly—possesses toddler level competency in Korean. I had been to Korea once with family when I was 17. My friend had never been, and her mother hadn’t been back in 45 years. The goal of our trip was food, fun, and spoiling ourselves. Total step count: 135,252 over 7 days.

 

**Day 1- Crash course**

Late afternoon landing at Incheon Airport, easy lesson in navigating subway system with a ride to the station closest to our hotel in Myeongdong. Perhaps we prolonged our suffering by choosing subway over cab because we were hauling large suitcases. Exiting Myeongdong station with the bustle of endless lights and action was a fever dream after the 12-hour flight. We chugged coffee, then a bottle of muscat flavored soju, and joined parents for a guided food tour of Gwangjang market. Highlights were kalguksu, kimchi and tofu mandu, and a cinnamon sugar donut with a texture as light as air. The market was friendly, intuitively laid out, and would have been easily navigable without a guide as well. We crashed back at our hotel, marveling on the subway ride home how quiet and clean the train was.



**Day 2- Wandering day**

Woke up jetlagged, just in time to catch the 6am sunrise dappling through the peaceful waters of the Cheonggyecheon (a sunken freshwater stream with miles of walking path and an impressive array of wildlife that cuts right through Seoul). I walked a few miles each way, exiting at Dongdaemun to explore the old city wall park and pick out favorite banchan at the just-opening food market. Picked up an iced coffee and threw a tiny pre-breakfast picnic along the Cheonggyecheon. My friend ran this route in the opposite direction, which became her near-daily run. Next-level breakfast buffet with Korean and western options at our hotel (Solaria hotel in Myeongdong). Two hour intense lymphatic massage and facials per our hotel’s rec and booking help, followed by spicy grilled squid and beer from a street stall in Dongdaemun and several more miles of walking. Traditional Korean hanjeongsik dinner with my friend’s family member, followed by a long nighttime walk through the bars and pochas just north of Myeongdong (near Jongno 3-ga). Quickly fading after the incredible meal (highlight was a king oyster mushroom and sesame jeon), we vowed go come back and visit the pochas another night.



**Day 3- Where the young people are**

My friend spent the daytime learning about Korean history on a family walking tour of palaces and historical sites. Given that I’d done a similar tour when I was 17 visiting Korea with my family, I set out to explore Hongdae and adjacent Yeonnam. I started with a climbing session in Yeonnam. The routesetters were creative with a variety of slabs and overhang problems that did not rely on the climber being 6ft tall, which is my biggest qualm with American gyms. I was amazed by the cleanliness of the gym –there was even a footwash station! This was hands down the best smelling climbing gym I have been to. I walked a couple steps to Gyeongui line forest park and enjoyed an egg sandwich in this gorgeous ‘highline-esque’ park along an old rail track. I had to bend down and physically touch some of the flowers to convince myself they were real. The colors and shapes were so lurid they initially appeared to be cut from construction paper. I spent a couple hours customizing shorts at the Nike store, admiring sneaker designs, and spending my paycheck on sportswear. The designs and fits were refreshingly different from what I see in the US. I joined my friend back at the hotel for a long nap before we headed out again at 9pm. We started our night at a small bar in Itaewon called Cul Sec. Every signature cocktail we tried was outstanding and the toasted yuzu cocktail was my favorite drink of the trip. Then, we headed to the main Itaewon party streets and picked out a pub where we enjoyed butter grilled squid and spicy sujebe with somaek. The butter grilled squid was one of my favorite bites of the trip. Next stop: queer karaoke night, where a woman crushed Amy Winehouse tunes. The vibe was energetic, friendly, and not too packed as it was a Thursday. Our final stop was the Jongno 3-ga pocha street, where we downed haemul pajeon, tteokbokki, and more somaek before the pocha closed at 4am. Altogether an unforgettable boozy night that was largely unplanned and guided by the whim of our wandering appetites.

 

**Day 4- Spa recovery**

After relishing 2 hrs of sleep, we grabbed the parents for an adrenaline-fueled 7am dash to Seoul station where we set out to Busan. I nursed my hangover with an iced Americano while my friend managed to down some more spicy squid from the train station. I stared out the window of the KTX train, successfully not vomiting (thank goodness that train ride is smooth); following a final miserable taxi ride through pouring rain from Busan station we made it to our destination: Spa Land. What followed was an immersive sensory experience and perfect hangover recovery. I have enjoyed a Korean spa in the US, and one in Korea, but had never seen anything near this scale. In bare feet, towels, and spa clothes, we enjoyed the massive immaculate 3-story facility over 8 hours. We lay in silence on a heated floor as rain pummeled the glass ceiling, popped between steam rooms, napped in hammocks, successfully tested our hangover bellies with ice cream and self-serve ramen, and enjoyed intense hour-long facials. I noticed a woman in front of me in the ramen line wiping off a few crumbs that had accumulated on the self-serve counter (even though she hadn’t spilled anything) and realized that her behavior would be unfathomable in the US. The level of respect for public spaces was striking throughout our trip. After the spa, we sleepily explored the megalophobia-inducing Busan Shinsegae mall (the largest department store in the world) and napped. We woke at 10pm and grabbed perhaps the most delicious dinner of the trip: a generous eomuk hotpot and side plate of spicy fried chicken. I had never seen this variety of eomuk before, which I learned is a regional specialty of Busan. As fishcake steam filled my nostrils and opened my pores, I sighed happily, feeling that the hangover recovery process had finally reached completion.



**Day 5 – Seafood and self-healing**

We joined the parents for a lovely traditional Korean breakfast in Busan. The beef and leek fritters and clam miyyeokguk were my favorite breakfast of the trip. We showed off the impressive Shinsegae mall to the parents (the food court was even more impressive in the morning with all the bakeries rolling out fresh food) before making our way to Jagalchi fish market. We picked live snow crab, fish, clams, and octopus before making our way upstairs to enjoy the fresh seafood. This was my favorite lunch of the trip. I ate the crab quickly with savage joy as we swore not to miss our KTX train back to Seoul. Crispy grilled flounder, which I usually think of as a boring fish, reached new heights here. While on the train back to Busan I arranged to climb with newfound queer Korean friends. I rushed to shower and become somewhat presentable to my fellow lesbians before heading back to the gym in Yeonnam. The Saturday evening gym was more crowded but somehow still not stinky. I joined two women at the gym—both creatives engrained in the local queer scene. I was fascinated. As the child of a Korean immigrant who reacted very poorly to my coming out, I assumed that modern Korean society would thoroughly stamp out queer joy. Yet here we were, connecting between climbs about recent dating mishaps and favorite L word characters. My new friends invited me out for post-climbing drinks and dinner at their favorite lesbian spots, prefacing kindly, ‘you will see a lot of women’. Sure, I thought to myself...good luck beating the US. What I saw surprised and delighted me beyond my wildest expectations. My American gay hubris was decimated. They showed me nightlife spaces for queer women that ranged from large restaurant style venues with waitlists so long we couldn’t get in for hours; intimate pubs with curated menus of drinking food; thumping hip hop clubs. One raging club had bartenders dressed as construction workers with tiny crates of deadly shots that were complimentary if you bought food at the women-owned pub next door. I set my backpack on the floor and happily immersed myself in the sea of dancing women. We left hours later once the crowd claustrophobia surpassed anything I had experienced even in major US cities during Pride month. My experience in American clubs led me to expect my backpack trampled on the floor somewhere but I was touched to find that someone had placed it on a table for me to find. Our magical night reconciled the queer and Korean parts of myself, relating them to one another rather than casting them in opposition. My new friend tucked me into a cab and I slept soundly that night, dreaming happy tears for my gays on the other side of the world.



**Day 6- A fancy day**

My friend was already on her morning Cheonggyecheon run by the time I woke up at 8AM, miraculously not hungover. I met her at a Paris Baguette in Insadong, where we enjoyed pastries and black coffee. Cream bread was simple and a standout. We moseyed through the arts district, admiring traditional crafts, and visited an artisan coffee shop. The black coffee was rich and almost thick in texture—too much for my weak taste buds. I preferred my iced Americano from Paris Baguette, which I fully realize probably makes me basic. I took my friend to Hongdae so she could customize a bunch of sweatshirts. We showered and refreshed ourselves with hot tea and fresh grapefruit juice (why isn’t it as tasty in the US??) before heading with the parents to a Zest, a World’s Top 50 Bar in Gangnam focused on sustainable ingredients. The sunny cocktail bar was fully seated at 3pm. The bartenders explained each ingredient when we chose our drinks. I enjoyed a lovely, strong drink made with millet soju, corn silk, and bell pepper, with a grainy and familiar tasting rub on the rim meant to evoke the harvesting process. We made our way to Seoul forest station where we explored the Seoul botanic park wetland preserve, before walking around the streets of Seongsu-dong and finding a barbeque spot for dinner. This neighborhood had a distinct artistic avant garde vibe. We chased our barbeque dinner with injeolmi bingsu back in Myeungdong, followed by whiskey highball cocktails. My favorite classic cocktail is an old fashioned, so I wasn’t sure if I would enjoy this lighter take on whiskey, but I was pleasantly surprised.



**Day 7- Too happy to be sad**

I expected to be sad on our last day, but a morning walk along the Cheonggyecheon lifted my spirits. I watched an egret catch a fish. I was awed that I could see this sort of wildlife in the middle of the city. I picked up several boxes of black sesame injeolmi at Young Man Dduck as souvenirs to enjoy over breakfast for the next week (and to send to my mom). My friend and I visited the Olive Young store in Myeungdong. I was expecting a generic chain like Sephora, but the décor, layout, and emphasis on skin care (over makeup) were all appealing. I picked out my favorite sunscreens and my wallet wept. We made our final stop at Olive Chicken before heading to the airport. We ordered a half original/half super spicy plate of fried chicken with somaek. I didn’t let a single bite go to waste. Hot chicken burning my lips, somaek buzzing my brain, I felt more happy than sad.



*Final impressions –*

Korea was perfect for me as someone who doesn’t like to overplan. Wandering and following a basic set of goals (“Today I want to go to the spa/see art/go climbing/get to the market at sunrise/drink”) was enough planning for me and my friend, and the rest of the magic followed. The only reservation we made ahead of our trip was the Zest in Gangnam. The best food was found through wandering, looking up local spots on Kakao Maps, and our planned trip to the fish market. Walking is also delightful because the green spaces in Seoul are thriving.

It was very touching to see my friend’s mom (Korean American) experience Korea for the first time in 45 years. She was shocked and impressed at how far Korea had come. She soaked up Korean historical tours like a sponge, and shared all her new knowledge with us over breakfast. I felt very lucky to get to go with my friend’s mom and get her perspective during our trip.

I cannot wait to go back soon.",9,Trip Report,"I'm neither female or queer, but as a Korean American - I felt this story in my bones. Very different experience for me, as a cis hetero male, but still, there is that weird sense of belonging and not belonging, that homecoming/first time experience that's hard to explain. I'm so glad you got to enjoy the Korean queer night life!! As I was starting your post I was genuinely worried you might have had a negative experience, but it seems like Korea is really starting to open up. It sounds like you had the maximum amount of fun and leisure out of your trip and I truly hope you get a chance to return again sometime soon.

I miss Korea, too, but having lived there for four years as an adult trying to reconnect with my culture, I'm satisfied being a visitor from time to time.

This is a reflection and summary of time spent during an unforgettable whirlwind weeklong trip. For context, we are two half-Korean, 30-something, female, American surgical residents. My friend’s parents joined. Writer (me) is proudly queer and culturally somewhat Korean (e.g. knows how to cook mid-level Korean food), and—less proudly—possesses toddler level competency in Korean. I had been to Korea once with family when I was 17. My friend had never been, and her mother hadn’t been back in 45 years. The goal of our trip was food, fun, and spoiling ourselves. Total step count: 135,252 over 7 days.

 

**Day 1- Crash course**

Late afternoon landing at Incheon Airport, easy lesson in navigating subway system with a ride to the station closest to our hotel in Myeongdong. Perhaps we prolonged our suffering by choosing subway over cab because we were hauling large suitcases. Exiting Myeongdong station with the bustle of endless lights and action was a fever dream after the 12-hour flight. We chugged coffee, then a bottle of muscat flavored soju, and joined parents for a guided food tour of Gwangjang market. Highlights were kalguksu, kimchi and tofu mandu, and a cinnamon sugar donut with a texture as light as air. The market was friendly, intuitively laid out, and would have been easily navigable without a guide as well. We crashed back at our hotel, marveling on the subway ride home how quiet and clean the train was.



**Day 2- Wandering day**

Woke up jetlagged, just in time to catch the 6am sunrise dappling through the peaceful waters of the Cheonggyecheon (a sunken freshwater stream with miles of walking path and an impressive array of wildlife that cuts right through Seoul). I walked a few miles each way, exiting at Dongdaemun to explore the old city wall park and pick out favorite banchan at the just-opening food market. Picked up an iced coffee and threw a tiny pre-breakfast picnic along the Cheonggyecheon. My friend ran this route in the opposite direction, which became her near-daily run. Next-level breakfast buffet with Korean and western options at our hotel (Solaria hotel in Myeongdong). Two hour intense lymphatic massage and facials per our hotel’s rec and booking help, followed by spicy grilled squid and beer from a street stall in Dongdaemun and several more miles of walking. Traditional Korean hanjeongsik dinner with my friend’s family member, followed by a long nighttime walk through the bars and pochas just north of Myeongdong (near Jongno 3-ga). Quickly fading after the incredible meal (highlight was a king oyster mushroom and sesame jeon), we vowed go come back and visit the pochas another night.



**Day 3- Where the young people are**

My friend spent the daytime learning about Korean history on a family walking tour of palaces and historical sites. Given that I’d done a similar tour when I was 17 visiting Korea with my family, I set out to explore Hongdae and adjacent Yeonnam. I started with a climbing session in Yeonnam. The routesetters were creative with a variety of slabs and overhang problems that did not rely on the climber being 6ft tall, which is my biggest qualm with American gyms. I was amazed by the cleanliness of the gym –there was even a footwash station! This was hands down the best smelling climbing gym I have been to. I walked a couple steps to Gyeongui line forest park and enjoyed an egg sandwich in this gorgeous ‘highline-esque’ park along an old rail track. I had to bend down and physically touch some of the flowers to convince myself they were real. The colors and shapes were so lurid they initially appeared to be cut from construction paper. I spent a couple hours customizing shorts at the Nike store, admiring sneaker designs, and spending my paycheck on sportswear. The designs and fits were refreshingly different from what I see in the US. I joined my friend back at the hotel for a long nap before we headed out again at 9pm. We started our night at a small bar in Itaewon called Cul Sec. Every signature cocktail we tried was outstanding and the toasted yuzu cocktail was my favorite drink of the trip. Then, we headed to the main Itaewon party streets and picked out a pub where we enjoyed butter grilled squid and spicy sujebe with somaek. The butter grilled squid was one of my favorite bites of the trip. Next stop: queer karaoke night, where a woman crushed Amy Winehouse tunes. The vibe was energetic, friendly, and not too packed as it was a Thursday. Our final stop was the Jongno 3-ga pocha street, where we downed haemul pajeon, tteokbokki, and more somaek before the pocha closed at 4am. Altogether an unforgettable boozy night that was largely unplanned and guided by the whim of our wandering appetites.

 

**Day 4- Spa recovery**

After relishing 2 hrs of sleep, we grabbed the parents for an adrenaline-fueled 7am dash to Seoul station where we set out to Busan. I nursed my hangover with an iced Americano while my friend managed to down some more spicy squid from the train station. I stared out the window of the KTX train, successfully not vomiting (thank goodness that train ride is smooth); following a final miserable taxi ride through pouring rain from Busan station we made it to our destination: Spa Land. What followed was an immersive sensory experience and perfect hangover recovery. I have enjoyed a Korean spa in the US, and one in Korea, but had never seen anything near this scale. In bare feet, towels, and spa clothes, we enjoyed the massive immaculate 3-story facility over 8 hours. We lay in silence on a heated floor as rain pummeled the glass ceiling, popped between steam rooms, napped in hammocks, successfully tested our hangover bellies with ice cream and self-serve ramen, and enjoyed intense hour-long facials. I noticed a woman in front of me in the ramen line wiping off a few crumbs that had accumulated on the self-serve counter (even though she hadn’t spilled anything) and realized that her behavior would be unfathomable in the US. The level of respect for public spaces was striking throughout our trip. After the spa, we sleepily explored the megalophobia-inducing Busan Shinsegae mall (the largest department store in the world) and napped. We woke at 10pm and grabbed perhaps the most delicious dinner of the trip: a generous eomuk hotpot and side plate of spicy fried chicken. I had never seen this variety of eomuk before, which I learned is a regional specialty of Busan. As fishcake steam filled my nostrils and opened my pores, I sighed happily, feeling that the hangover recovery process had finally reached completion.



**Day 5 – Seafood and self-healing**

We joined the parents for a lovely traditional Korean breakfast in Busan. The beef and leek fritters and clam miyyeokguk were my favorite breakfast of the trip. We showed off the impressive Shinsegae mall to the parents (the food court was even more impressive in the morning with all the bakeries rolling out fresh food) before making our way to Jagalchi fish market. We picked live snow crab, fish, clams, and octopus before making our way upstairs to enjoy the fresh seafood. This was my favorite lunch of the trip. I ate the crab quickly with savage joy as we swore not to miss our KTX train back to Seoul. Crispy grilled flounder, which I usually think of as a boring fish, reached new heights here. While on the train back to Busan I arranged to climb with newfound queer Korean friends. I rushed to shower and become somewhat presentable to my fellow lesbians before heading back to the gym in Yeonnam. The Saturday evening gym was more crowded but somehow still not stinky. I joined two women at the gym—both creatives engrained in the local queer scene. I was fascinated. As the child of a Korean immigrant who reacted very poorly to my coming out, I assumed that modern Korean society would thoroughly stamp out queer joy. Yet here we were, connecting between climbs about recent dating mishaps and favorite L word characters. My new friends invited me out for post-climbing drinks and dinner at their favorite lesbian spots, prefacing kindly, ‘you will see a lot of women’. Sure, I thought to myself...good luck beating the US. What I saw surprised and delighted me beyond my wildest expectations. My American gay hubris was decimated. They showed me nightlife spaces for queer women that ranged from large restaurant style venues with waitlists so long we couldn’t get in for hours; intimate pubs with curated menus of drinking food; thumping hip hop clubs. One raging club had bartenders dressed as construction workers with tiny crates of deadly shots that were complimentary if you bought food at the women-owned pub next door. I set my backpack on the floor and happily immersed myself in the sea of dancing women. We left hours later once the crowd claustrophobia surpassed anything I had experienced even in major US cities during Pride month. My experience in American clubs led me to expect my backpack trampled on the floor somewhere but I was touched to find that someone had placed it on a table for me to find. Our magical night reconciled the queer and Korean parts of myself, relating them to one another rather than casting them in opposition. My new friend tucked me into a cab and I slept soundly that night, dreaming happy tears for my gays on the other side of the world.



**Day 6- A fancy day**

My friend was already on her morning Cheonggyecheon run by the time I woke up at 8AM, miraculously not hungover. I met her at a Paris Baguette in Insadong, where we enjoyed pastries and black coffee. Cream bread was simple and a standout. We moseyed through the arts district, admiring traditional crafts, and visited an artisan coffee shop. The black coffee was rich and almost thick in texture—too much for my weak taste buds. I preferred my iced Americano from Paris Baguette, which I fully realize probably makes me basic. I took my friend to Hongdae so she could customize a bunch of sweatshirts. We showered and refreshed ourselves with hot tea and fresh grapefruit juice (why isn’t it as tasty in the US??) before heading with the parents to a Zest, a World’s Top 50 Bar in Gangnam focused on sustainable ingredients. The sunny cocktail bar was fully seated at 3pm. The bartenders explained each ingredient when we chose our drinks. I enjoyed a lovely, strong drink made with millet soju, corn silk, and bell pepper, with a grainy and familiar tasting rub on the rim meant to evoke the harvesting process. We made our way to Seoul forest station where we explored the Seoul botanic park wetland preserve, before walking around the streets of Seongsu-dong and finding a barbeque spot for dinner. This neighborhood had a distinct artistic avant garde vibe. We chased our barbeque dinner with injeolmi bingsu back in Myeungdong, followed by whiskey highball cocktails. My favorite classic cocktail is an old fashioned, so I wasn’t sure if I would enjoy this lighter take on whiskey, but I was pleasantly surprised.



**Day 7- Too happy to be sad**

I expected to be sad on our last day, but a morning walk along the Cheonggyecheon lifted my spirits. I watched an egret catch a fish. I was awed that I could see this sort of wildlife in the middle of the city. I picked up several boxes of black sesame injeolmi at Young Man Dduck as souvenirs to enjoy over breakfast for the next week (and to send to my mom). My friend and I visited the Olive Young store in Myeungdong. I was expecting a generic chain like Sephora, but the décor, layout, and emphasis on skin care (over makeup) were all appealing. I picked out my favorite sunscreens and my wallet wept. We made our final stop at Olive Chicken before heading to the airport.

Hot chicken burning my lips, somaek buzzing my brain, I felt more happy than sad.

Day 1 (Seoul) 
Arrived at Seoul mid noon.  Booked Airport transfer via Klook.

Reviews indicated Klook airport transfers can be a hit or miss.  Since I got a good deal at the time of booking, I decided to risk it.  Or else, you may choose to book Limo Bus or Uber taxi at the airport. I booked pick up time 2 hrs after landing to give enough time for clearing customs, pick up baggage, wow pass, esims, topups, cash withdrawal and etc. Klook gives 30mins free waiting time.

Things I did at the airport. 
- picked up prebooked Wow pass card at airport's CU convenience store.  Registered card to app and topup via app (with charges) linked to credit/debit card. 
- Topup T money via Wow pass app.  Strangely this can only be done for Samsung or Apple devices with NFC.

You can transfer funds via Wow pass. But you cannot transfer funds via Tmoney. 
-Wow pass with Esim (local calls) package will have to be picked up at SK Telcos counter as they need to register your passport for local calls function. 

Checked into L7 Hongdae.  Hotel's location is very good.  Walking distance to shops and subway stations.  There is a wowpass machine in the hotel too where you can withdraw KRW directly with one of the 16 countries currencies. 

Things i did that day via subway ride:
- took 1hr ride subway to Gangnam area for color analysis. 
- Visited Starfield library. 
-ate at random restos at Hongdae
- Stroll and window shopped along Hongdae. 

Shops and restos opened till late. Most Koreans do not speak English or product labels are in Korean language, so Papago helps. 

Day 2 (Nami and surrounding) 
This is the only day i use cash to pay the driver for entrance upon his request. But i noticed if we were to get the tickets ourselves at the entrance, I can use card but maybe driver wants to earn commission.  So I let it go. 

Day tour to 3 locations below:

First stop Alpaca World.  Took 2.5 hrs plus drive from Seoul as it was super traffic.  Got there at around 945am.  Alpaca shows at 10am.  Its basically watching Alpacas running down the slop to be fed by tourist. Alpaca feed was provided by the marshals there. Spent maybe 1.5hrs there. 

Second stop Nami. Its a 1hr 15mins.  Then took a 5 to 10mins ferry ride there.  This place was made famous by Kdrama Winter Sonata.  Thus unless you are a fan, I won't recommend to purposely go there.  Had lunch on the Island and walked around.  Spent around 2 hrs there. 

Third stop Morning Calm Garden. Its a 40 mins drive. Walked around for 1.5hr or so.

Then back to Seoul.

This is already a private tour with no senior or children, we still ran overtime due to traffic.  Traffic took more than 4 hrs out of the 10hrs.  We started at Hondae at 740am and got back at 7pm. 

This is my PERSONAL opinion: 
It is not worth the long drive to those locations and expensive.  I find it's way way overhyped.  For the time spent on the road, it's better spent it elsewhere. There are many nice hikes near the city like Namsan.  

Day 3 (Seoul - Gyeongju day trip - Busan)

All payment via card for this day. 

Took 35mins Uber ride from Hongdae to Seoul Station for KTX train to Gyeongju.  It was easy to navigate the train station.  Train ride was around 2hrs 15mins.

KTX ride was seamless and straight forward.  Tickets were booked 30 days before travel dates since its a weekend and can get fully booked. 

Upon arrival at Singyeongju station, my private guide meet up with us at 1130am for an 8.5hrs tour including 1.5 hrs drive to Busan. 

1st stop Bulguksa Temple
Try not to go on weekend!! 
We went on a weekend and didn't expect heavy traffic in small town of Gyeongju.  Spent more than 1 hr time wasted on traffic into Bulguksa temple!!  

2nd stop Daereungwon (Cheonmachong Tomb).  We went inside the tomb museum.  It was interesting but small museum.  So it did not take long. 

3rd stop Hwangnidan-gil
This is a shopping streets.  Ate our lunch there.  Cold raw beef noodles was yummy.
Queued and tried the corn ice cream. Nothing to die for.  Note: if you don't like Q but want to try it, you can try it in Myeodong.  No queue there. 

Was disappointed guide didn't bring us to the Cheomseongdae Observatory  as it was just next to the tomb as she is somehow rushing to get us back to Busan.  

4th stop Gyochon village (the only interesting part is to cross the river in stone to view Woljeonggyo)

5th stop Woljeonggyo Bridge Wish we could have stayed till evening to see lited up.  Was very disappointed. 

- Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.  Same as 5th.

Then drive 1.5 hrs to Busan.  Checked in an L7 Haeundae.  Another nice hotel with good location.  There is Wow pass machine too and 7/11 in the hotel. 

Tip:  If you booked private day tour with limited time, I would recommend the tour start a little late so you can watch the lights lit up on the Woljeonggyo bridge and Donggung Palace. 

With this stopover, it creates some problem with luggages.  Thus I'd suggest either:
-stay overnight in Gyeongju or
-leave luggage at Gyeongju KTX station (ktx is around 30min to 45 mins to Bulguksa). After tour, go back to KTX station and proceed to Busan. 
- Take bus from Gyeongju station to city and leave luggage in city lockers (I dont know where but I watched youtube there is) . Tour around.  Thereafter take intercity bus to Busan. 
- Pack necessary things in backpack and leave luggage in your hotel in seoul or rent a locker. 
- or hire private tour or vehicle to bring you around with pur luggages then drop you off at Busan. 
- stay 3 nights in Busan and do day trip. 

Day 4 (Busan) 
Free and easy.  
Used uber going around these places since we have limited time. 

All payment via card for this day. 

-Gamcheon culture village. 
-Songdo park and cable car ride with bridge walk. 
-Huinnyeoul Culture Village
-Haeundae Blue Line Park

From Haeundae to Gamcheon takes around 30 mins.  Activities listed centered around those areas except for the Blue Line Park. 

Highlight was Gamcheon culture village.  One can spend hours exploring the small alleyways taking ig photos or just enjoy the views.

Songdo park is another nice hiking place where one can spend hours!! 

Huinnyeoul culture village has a similar concept but at smaller scale. 

Haeundae beach area is another nice place to hike one end to the other.  As for the blue line train ride (i didnt to capsule), the whole stretch train track is around 4km.  For those who loves walking, I'd would suggest to buy one way then walk back. 

The other end of the beach (where Westin hotel is located) is another hike area.  

There a food Avenue in Haeundae which lots of choice.  There is a small food alley with seafood too where some places have long queues like 30mins.  Out of curiosity, we also join the queue for the tempura and hotteak pancake.  I find its nothing to die for.. its actually ""meh"" especially the tempuras...they just reheat it and its full of batter.  Its just not worth the queue.  I have eaten better ones.  

Day 5 (Busan to Seoul) 
Took 40mins uber ride from Haeundae to Busan KTX station back to Seoul.  

All payment via card this day. 

This time we stayed in Myeodong area. 

From Myeodong, we walked all the way to Namsan Radio Tower.  For hikers, just hike up and down instead of taking cable car.  One can spent hours there too if you enjoy hikes and nature and taking ig photos. 

After that, back to Myeodong for window shopping the street food which is open at around 4pm ish.

Street food vendors accepts card, E Wallets (with QR code sign) and cash. 

Day 6 (DMZ with Majang Bridge) 
Tour starts at 7am meeting at one of the exit in Myeongdong station.  It was a rainy amd foggy day. 

Tours starts almost on time. Can't see anything due to the rain and heavy fog.  

Visited 3rd tunnel.  
Note: This does not suit disabled or unfit or claustrophobic persons as it is a steep climb back.. 

After that, had lunch in a village with a small shops selling local produce.  

Then headed to Majang Bridge park.  I like this place.  Hikers will like it too.  Since we join tour, there is time limit. 

Got back by around 4:30pm

Day 7

 Full day DIY tour 
Walked from Myeodong to Gyeongbokgung Palace.  On the way, passed by 'The Stream'. 

Entrance to palace is krw3000.  Free if you wear hanbok.  Rent hanbok starts from kwn9000 per hr to cheapest krw15000 whole day.  We wanted to get the 15000 whole day however the queue was too long.  So instead of wasting time, we rented from a shop with hairdo for krw45000 for 4hrs.

Spent 3hrs walking and taking photos there. 

Next walked from Gyeongbokgung to Bukchon Village.  Its a residential area. The highlights is the alley with hanok style houses. 

On the way saw a Michelin star original ginseng chicken soup.  So had a late lunch. 

Then back to Myeodong.  Ate yummy street food there. All popular korean brands are there. 

Day 8
Check out. 
Rode 1hr uber XL to incheon airport. 

Re tax refund, some shops accepts direct tax refund while some have kiosk where you scan the details.  Bring your passport. 
There is also kiosk in the airport before and after immigration.  Choosed USD tax refund.  Queue and process was fast for me tho didnt buy much.

First stop Alpaca World.  Took 2.5 hrs plus drive from Seoul as it was super traffic.  Got there at around 945am.  Alpaca shows at 10am.  Its basically watching Alpacas running down the slop to be fed by tourist. Alpaca feed was provided by the marshals there. Spent maybe 1.5hrs there. 

Second stop Nami. Its a 1hr 15mins.  Then took a 5 to 10mins ferry ride there.  This place was made famous by Kdrama Winter Sonata.  Thus unless you are a fan, I won't recommend to purposely go there.  Had lunch on the Island and walked around.  Spent around 2 hrs there. 

Third stop Morning Calm Garden. Its a 40 mins drive. Walked around for 1.5hr or so.

Then back to Seoul.

This is already a private tour with no senior or children, we still ran overtime due to traffic.  Traffic took more than 4 hrs out of the 10hrs.  We started at Hondae at 740am and got back at 7pm. 

This is my PERSONAL opinion: 
It is not worth the long drive to those locations and expensive.  I find it's way way overhyped.  For the time spent on the road, it's better spent it elsewhere. There are many nice hikes near the city like Namsan.  

Day 3 (Seoul - Gyeongju day trip - Busan)

All payment via card for this day. 

Took 35mins Uber ride from Hongdae to Seoul Station for KTX train to Gyeongju.  It was easy to navigate the train station.  Train ride was around 2hrs 15mins.

KTX ride was seamless and straight forward.  Tickets were booked 30 days before travel dates since its a weekend and can get fully booked. 

Upon arrival at Singyeongju station, my private guide meet up with us at 1130am for an 8.5hrs tour including 1.5 hrs drive to Busan. 

1st stop Bulguksa Temple
Try not to go on weekend!! 
We went on a weekend and didn't expect heavy traffic in small town of Gyeongju.  Spent more than 1 hr time wasted on traffic into Bulguksa temple!!  

2nd stop Daereungwon (Cheonmachong Tomb).  We went inside the tomb museum.  It was interesting but small museum.  So it did not take long. 

3rd stop Hwangnidan-gil
This is a shopping streets.  Ate our lunch there.  Cold raw beef noodles was yummy.
Queued and tried the corn ice cream. Nothing to die for.  Note: if you don't like Q but want to try it, you can try it in Myeodong.  No queue there. 

Was disappointed guide didn't bring us to the Cheomseongdae Observatory  as it was just next to the tomb as she is somehow rushing to get us back to Busan.  

4th stop Gyochon village (the only interesting part is to cross the river in stone to view Woljeonggyo)

5th stop Woljeonggyo Bridge Wish we could have stayed till evening to see lited up.  Was very disappointed. 

- Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.  Same as 5th.

Then drive 1.5 hrs to Busan.  Checked in an L7 Haeundae.  Another nice hotel with good location.  There is Wow pass machine too and 7/11 in the hotel. 

Tip:  If you booked private day tour with limited time, I would recommend the tour start a little late so you can watch the lights lit up on the Woljeonggyo bridge and Donggung Palace. 

With this stopover, it creates some problem with luggages.  Thus I'd suggest either:
-stay overnight in Gyeongju or
-leave luggage at Gyeongju KTX station (ktx is around 30min to 45 mins to Bulguksa). After tour, go back to KTX station and proceed to Busan. 
- Take bus from Gyeongju station to city and leave luggage in city lockers (I dont know where but I watched youtube there is) . Tour around.  Thereafter take intercity bus to Busan. 
- Pack necessary things in backpack and leave luggage in your hotel in seoul or rent a locker. 
- or hire private tour or vehicle to bring you around with pur luggages then drop you off at Busan. 
- stay 3 nights in Busan and do day trip. 

Day 4 (Busan) 
Free and easy.  
Used uber going around these places since we have limited time. 

All payment via card for this day. 

-Gamcheon culture village. 
-Songdo park and cable car ride with bridge walk. 
-Huinnyeoul Culture Village
-Haeundae Blue Line Park

From Haeundae to Gamcheon takes around 30 mins.  Activities listed centered around those areas except for the Blue Line Park. 

Highlight was Gamcheon culture village.  One can spend hours exploring the small alleyways taking ig photos or just enjoy the views.

Songdo park is another nice hiking place where one can spend hours!! 

Huinnyeoul culture village has a similar concept but at smaller scale. 

Haeundae beach area is another nice place to hike one end to the other.  As for the blue line train ride (i didnt to capsule), the whole stretch train track is around 4km.  For those who loves walking, I'd would suggest to buy one way then walk back. 

The other end of the beach (where Westin hotel is located) is another hike area.  

There a food Avenue in Haeundae which lots of choice.  There is a small food alley with seafood too where some places have long queues like 30mins.  Out of curiosity, we also join the queue for the tempura and hotteak pancake.  I find its nothing to die for.. its actually ""meh"" especially the tempuras...they just reheat it and its full of batter.  Its just not worth the queue.  I have eaten better ones.  

Day 5 (Busan to Seoul) 
Took 40mins uber ride from Haeundae to Busan KTX station back to Seoul.  

All payment via card this day. 

This time we stayed in Myeodong area. 

From Myeodong, we walked all the way to Namsan Radio Tower.  For hikers, just hike up and down instead of taking cable car.  One can spent hours there too if you enjoy hikes and nature and taking ig photos. 

After that, back to Myeodong for window shopping the street food which is open at around 4pm ish.

Street food vendors accepts card, E Wallets (with QR code sign) and cash. 

Day 6 (DMZ with Majang Bridge) 
Tour starts at 7am meeting at one of the exit in Myeongdong station.  It was a rainy amd foggy day. 

Tours starts almost on time. Can't see anything due to the rain and heavy fog.  

Visited 3rd tunnel.  
Note: This does not suit disabled or unfit or claustrophobic persons as it is a steep climb back.. 

After that, had lunch in a village with a small shops selling local produce.  

Then headed to Majang Bridge park.  I like this place.  Hikers will like it too.  Since we join tour, there is time limit. 

Got back by around 4:30pm

Day 7

 Full day DIY tour 
Walked from Myeodong to Gyeongbokgung Palace.  On the way, passed by 'The Stream'. 

Entrance to palace is krw3000.  Free if you wear hanbok.  Rent hanbok starts from kwn9000 per hr to cheapest krw15000 whole day.  We wanted to get the 15000 whole day however the queue was too long.  So instead of wasting time, we rented from a shop with hairdo for krw45000 for 4hrs.

Spent 3hrs walking and taking photos there. 

Next walked from Gyeongbokgung to Bukchon Village.  Its a residential area. The highlights is the alley with hanok style houses. 

On the way saw a Michelin star original ginseng chicken soup.  So had a late lunch. 

Then back to Myeodong.  Ate yummy street food there. All popular korean brands are there. 

Day 8
Check out. 
Rode 1hr uber XL to incheon airport. 

Re tax refund, some shops accepts direct tax refund while some have kiosk where you scan the details.  Bring your passport. 
There is also kiosk in the airport before and after immigration.  Choosed USD tax refund.  Queue and process was fast for me tho didnt buy much. 

Hope this helps.  Thank you for sharing such a well written report! May I just ask where the first image was taken?"

Seoul - 6 days

Busan - 3 days

Jeju - 3 days

DMZ - 1 day

Not including travel days.

Seoul was a lot of fun, particularly during the evening. It took some adjustment, because I am a morning person and the city is quite quiet during this time, but it was worth staying up late to experience the high energy atmosphere at night. I particularly enjoyed cafe culture, shopping, and the palaces. The markets have a fun vibe i loved being a part of, but I typically bought one or two items only. For food, I really enjoyed the marinated crab at Gebang Sikdang, and the affordable set menu at Mater - the chef is very kind! I also found myself often in the middle of public outdoor joyful events unexpectedly. 

I enjoyed n tower early morning, loved walking cheonggyecheon stream during the evening, combined with the city wall walk. I also have great memories having dessert in front of donghodaegyo bridge during the light show.

Busan - I loved walking around busan, taking in the sights- beach, architecture, art, villages etc. I didn't go to as many events and venues as I did in seoul, but I didn't need to. It felt much more calm and casual. It might go without saying but food at Jackie's (fish market) was a dream, and I tried a few places with korean chicken and it was amazing every time. The culture village was very interesting, and the beach market combo was relaxing.

Jeju - a beautiful place I encourage everyone to visit. The bus system is good, provided you are proximate to a main line, but I encourage people to check out the tours. They're very affordable, and take you around the island so efficiently- no second is wasted imo. Our guide was very knowledgeable and kind, giving us her favourite snakes between stops. 

Also, make sure to reserve at least half a day to relax at the beach and swim. Despite not being someone who likes to sunbath or stay in one place, it was a highlight because of how picturesque and peaceful it is. I enjoyed all the food I tried here, especially the rock salt grilled seafood dishes. Also the green tea!

Dmz - take a tour rather than attempting this yourself. It requires an early wake up but it's worth it. The earlier the better. If you are fit enough, go down into the third tunnel. It's an eye opening experience you can’t emulate anywhere else in the world i suspect.

A few other points

I don't drive, and that was never an issue for me.

Be prepared to spend money at olive young. The opportunity is enticing and prices alluring. The advertising around Seoul works. 

Everyone was very kind. This seems to go understated. I was called beautiful by strangers on three occasions. I don't think it's accurate lol, but indicative of peoples reactions to foreigners in my experience - i got the sense of positivd curiosity and genuine interest (I have tanned skin so it may be different for others).

I never had any trouble solo dining. I never felt uncomfortable by cultural beauty standards. 

I took a lot of pictures of the sites I visited if anyone is looking for ideas. Let me know if you have any questions about them - https://www.instagram.com/adampc90?igsh=dXNybzBkaDFoOWps

1i3xhh2,[June in Korea] 9 days in Seoul and 3 days in Jeju Itinerary,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1i3xhh2/june_in_korea_9_days_in_seoul_and_3_days_in_jeju/,1737167229.0,"I haven't been in Korea for 26 years. I left it when I was a teenager, and now I am taking my American husband and two teenagers with me. This will be once in a lifetime visit to Korea for us. We're on a tight budget. I am fluent in Korean and the budget is in USD.

**Before the trip**

* Apply for the [International Driving Permit (IDP](https://www.usa.gov/international-drivers-license)) to drive a rental car in Jeju ($70 for two)
* Check [Travel Advisory and Alert](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthKorea.html#/).
* Download Kakaomap, Naver map, and Kakato T (Kakao T app sent me to k.ride app)
* Buy eSIM for two Apple phones, [option 1](https://saily.com/esim-south-korea/),[ option 2](https://chingumobile.com/), [option 3](https://mobimatter.com/esim-south-korea), and [option 4](https://bytesim.com/) 5GB is ample? 3GB is too slow? [SK Sim gives Korean phone number](https://krsim.net/)s - Which sSIM is better? How many GB? Note eSIM can call and use data but cannot receive calls, If you want to receive calls, get SIM.
* Purchase [Seoul Pass](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/3819-discover-seoul-pass-seoul/) (24 hours).

**Upon arrival at the Incheon airport**:

* Buy an eSIM if we didn’t buy it already.
* Pick up the discovery Seoul pass  at
   * Incheon Airport T1: Kbook(경인문고), 3rd floor near H line at 7:00 - 20:00
   *  Incheon Airport T2: BKbook(경인문고), 3rd floor near Counter F(Departure Hall) at 07:00-21:00
* 1st floor of Terminal 1, Gate No.4 Ticket Booth No. 21
* Buy 4 tickets W17000 x4 = $47 from the ticket machine for the **Airport Limousine Bus.**
* Ride for 90 minutes and get off at the stop near our hotel in Jongro.

**During the trip:**

* Ask for tax-free receipts along with regular receipts for tax refunds at the end of the trip.
* Can get tax refunds at malls.

**Before returning:**

* Get a tax refund by showing receipts and passports. There is more than one place. Terminal 1 near gate 28 has both a machine and a person.
* Martina lounge near gate 43 is small and too crowded 
* Martina lounge near gate 11 is bigger but we will be in line during meal times

**DAY 1**

* Dinner at [**Kwangjang Market**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294197-d1552278-Reviews-Kwangjang_Market-Seoul.html). It is within walking distance from our hotel.
   * I change my mind on Gwangjang (It seems to be spelled with K or G) market after seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwhbmORHbMs).
   * Store hours are 10 am - 6 pm
   * Street food opens until 11 pm
* Buy a [Climate card](https://english.seoul.go.kr/policy/transportation/climate-card/). Should I buy 1 card per person or 1 card for 4 of us?

If you see anything that I am mistaken or didn't think about, or have any suggestions, please kindly share it with me. I am budgeting $1700 for food and drink for 4 of us for 12 days. The hotel in Seoul and the B&B in Jeju provide breakfasts. So, $1700 will mostly be for lunch, dinner, snacks, and drinks. Does it sound reasonable? Thank you very much!",26,🏆Community Highlights,"If you're getting the discover seoul pass, it includes a ticket to lotte world and also the Korean Folk Village as an FYI. depending on your time it might be worth moving some stuff around to different days and getting a 48 hour pass | This post is **** awesome. Imma put “community highlights” on this | Very thorough, good work :)

For phone plan, I'd look at whatever your regular data usage is in the US, add more in consideration of your traveling and looking things up. It sucks to run out of data when you depend on it, especially when you have your maps up nearly constantly as a traveler. Just a note that esims are cheaper outside of incheon airport than in, but it's inconvenient to go without one between the airport and getting an esim. | The Seoul Metro Map is old (as of 2023).

If you see anything that I am mistaken or didn't think about, or have any suggestions, please kindly share it with me. I am budgeting $1700 for food and drink for 4 of us for 12 days. The hotel in Seoul and the B&B in Jeju provide breakfasts. So, $1700 will mostly be for lunch, dinner, snacks, and drinks. Does it sound reasonable? Thank you very much! If you're getting the discover seoul pass, it includes a ticket to lotte world and also the Korean Folk Village as an FYI. depending on your time it might be worth moving some stuff around to different days and getting a 48 hour pass | This post is **** awesome. Imma put “community highlights” on this | Very thorough, good work :)

For phone plan, I'd look at whatever your regular data usage is in the US, add more in consideration of your traveling and looking things up. It sucks to run out of data when you depend on it, especially when you have your maps up nearly constantly as a traveler. Just a note that esims are cheaper outside of incheon airport than in, but it's inconvenient to go without one between the airport and getting an esim. | The Seoul Metro Map is old (as of 2023).  Omits multiple subway lines that have opened since then. The current map can be found on [http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/en/index.do](http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/en/index.do) or by downloading [http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/download/map\_english.zip](http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/download/map_english.zip) | Taking N-Seoul Tower out is not a good choice.  It's the number one tourist spot in Seoul.  The ground floor observation deck is open 24 hours. You can take a public bus from 630am to 11pm 01A or 01B near Myeongdong Station at Namsan Yejang Bus Parking Lot that leaves every 10 minutes.  [https://www.nseoultower.co.kr/eng/visit/traffic.asp](https://www.nseoultower.co.kr/eng/visit/traffic.asp)  You could also take the cable car (10am-11p) or Seoul City Tour Bus (hop on hop off) (9a-4:50p) or walk from Myeongdong or Seoul Station (20 to 30 minutes)."

We just got back from 25 days in Korea! We had an amazing time and really hope to be able to return in the near future. I wanted to share our 25 day itinerary so others could glean ideas. We tend to prefer shopping and cultural activities over hiking, and our itinerary reflects that. We were very happy with all the things we did although it was a more aggressive itinerary to sustain for nearly 4 weeks. It was just me and my girlfriend for 18 days, then my son joined us for the last 7. I'd love to answer your questions!

**Money**

I brought about 1,500,000 Won in cash. It was good to have, but 1,000,000 would have been more than enough. I had anticipated going to street food markets much more than we actually did. Visa worked just fine pretty much everywhere. HOWEVER there were a few places where the chip reader didn't work and my card declined when it was swiped. Always good to have a backup option!

**eSIM**

My primary travel credit card (Citi Visa) frequently needed verification when I made online purchases; this was especially true when buying via Klook. I needed to receive a code via text, which meant I had to switch back to my US SIM card (thankful for eSIMs!!) and burn through a roaming day. Also, my Jeonju car reservation was made before I knew my Korea number. They texted me on my US number to let me know the office was closing. Luckily I had just needed to verify an online purchase anyway, otherwise I wouldn't have caught it.

Having a Korean number was nice and gave me more confidence, but I didn't need it much. It was useful when booking a taxi. It was very nice to get notifications when I used T-luggage. It was helpful at cafes that used text to notify you when your order was ready. I never made a reservation at a restaurant that needed it.

Having data is SUPER useful. Wifi is prevalent but not ubiquitous. But I'm not convinced that a Korean eSIM is necessarily better than getting an international plan with your current provider. 

**Transportation**

In Seoul and Busan we used subway and bus as our primary transportation, and it worked great. Very grateful to have booked hotels near subway stations. Naver maps is essential, but boy that interface is really frustrating sometimes. Figuring out which metro exits have elevators was a particular challenge when I was toting luggage around. I had some big misses that would've frustrated me more if I wasn't capable of hauling luggage up and down lots of steps. It really frustrated my girlfriend, and that was with me carrying some of her stuff already.

Having a car felt essential for Jeju. I was grateful to have it for Jeonju based on what I had on my itinerary, but if you're only going to the hanok village I don't think you'd want it. Figuring out gas stations was stressful; I was very grateful to have found a full service S-OIL station in Jeju and I'd recommend using full service stations if you're vacationing. Driving culture wasn't terribly different, though the race from speed camera to speed camera took some adjustment.

Booking a taxi was stressful. I only did it once, leaving Busan KTX station. The actual booking via Kakao T was fine, although they only let me book the ""black"" service so it wasn't cheap. There are two taxi stands there at opposite sides of the station, and I went to the wrong one. The driver kept texting me and calling me telling me to hurry, even though he had arrived 10 minutes before the scheduled pickup time. I didn't understand Korean well enough to understand where he said he was parked. It didn't feel great.

For excursions far outside the cities (Everland, Gyeongju, etc.) it seemed well worth my time to just book a tour instead of navigating public transportation. It was much faster and simpler (no transfers to worry about). If I was on a tighter budget I would've been fine with public transportation, but it would've taken about 50% longer. Part of this decision was that the tour pickup spots were VERY close to my hotels (Myeongdong and Haeundae) so keep that in mind - staying in the tourist hot spots does have some additional advantages for planning.

**Language**

Learn to read Hangul. Learn the names of Korean dishes. That's the biggest bang for your buck.

I've been studying Korean via apps for about 4 years in preparation for this trip. I can read pretty easily. I can formulate both simple and complex sentences to communicate my needs. But boy, I really really struggled with listening comprehension with native speakers. They were always delighted and pleasantly surprised to hear me speak Korean, and praised my pronunciation, but I just couldn't keep up with the flow of conversation and that had me a little sad. I never felt that it was strictly necessary. I always had Papago to fall back on (another reason to have data service), and there were plenty of people who knew enough English to get by. I was always able to communicate my needs in some way.

Counter service restaurant ordering is wonderful. It's usually via kiosk, and the kiosk almost always has an option to switch to English. These were primarily cafes and dessert locations.

**Lodging**

I took care to try to get a variety of different hotel options (traditional hotel, hanok stay, wellness resort, apartment) and we really enjoyed having that variety. It made every location feel more unique and special.

**Overall**

I was very pleased with how this itinerary worked out and would recommend something similar. I could've done another day on Jeju, probably in exchange for one of the Seoul days. But I don't regret how it all worked out. We got a nice variety of experiences across some key areas of the country. We had a few home bases that we could really get familiar with and settle into. I felt like I had overplanned for this vacation, but all the planning worked out. When things needed to change, I always had a backup plan or knew of another possible solution.

It all worked out, people were very kind and accommodating, and we had a magical time.",22,Trip Report!,"That’s too bad you guys didn’t go to spa land. They really don’t care about tattoos despite what the sign says.

Also, Uber app works well in Korea for taxis for your next trip | My Esim was way cheaper than using the international plan with my carrier. | I see you did a lot of shopping in Seoul. I’m not that much of a big shopping fan, would you recommend staying longer in Busan instead for people like me? I feel like there’s actually more to do in Busan when it comes to hiking/cable car rides etc there? Not sure though | Thanks so much for this! We’re going in October for about the same length of time. | Thanks for sharing your itinerary! For your lodgings, did you book everything in advance or did you book any day of? My family and I are going for 4 weeks and we've booked Seoul and Jeju, but we're hoping we can play the rest of the trip by ear.","25 day itinerary and report for Korea Hi everyone! We just got back from 25 days in Korea! We had an amazing time and really hope to be able to return in the near future. I wanted to share our 25 day itinerary so others could glean ideas. We tend to prefer shopping and cultural activities over hiking, and our itinerary reflects that. We were very happy with all the things we did although it was a more aggressive itinerary to sustain for nearly 4 weeks. It was just me and my girlfriend for 18 days, then my son joined us for the last 7. I'd love to answer your questions!

**Money**

I brought about 1,500,000 Won in cash. It was good to have, but 1,000,000 would have been more than enough. I had anticipated going to street food markets much more than we actually did. Visa worked just fine pretty much everywhere. HOWEVER there were a few places where the chip reader didn't work and my card declined when it was swiped. Always good to have a backup option!

**eSIM**

My primary travel credit card (Citi Visa) frequently needed verification when I made online purchases; this was especially true when buying via Klook. I needed to receive a code via text, which meant I had to switch back to my US SIM card (thankful for eSIMs!!) and burn through a roaming day. Also, my Jeonju car reservation was made before I knew my Korea number. They texted me on my US number to let me know the office was closing. Luckily I had just needed to verify an online purchase anyway, otherwise I wouldn't have caught it.

Having a Korean number was nice and gave me more confidence, but I didn't need it much. It was useful when booking a taxi. It was very nice to get notifications when I used T-luggage. It was helpful at cafes that used text to notify you when your order was ready. I never made a reservation at a restaurant that needed it.

Having data is SUPER useful. Wifi is prevalent but not ubiquitous. But I'm not convinced that a Korean eSIM is necessarily better than getting an international plan with your current provider. 

**Transportation**

In Seoul and Busan we used subway and bus as our primary transportation, and it worked great. Very grateful to have booked hotels near subway stations. Naver maps is essential, but boy that interface is really frustrating sometimes. Figuring out which metro exits have elevators was a particular challenge when I was toting luggage around. I had some big misses that would've frustrated me more if I wasn't capable of hauling luggage up and down lots of steps. It really frustrated my girlfriend, and that was with me carrying some of her stuff already.

Having a car felt essential for Jeju. I was grateful to have it for Jeonju based on what I had on my itinerary, but if you're only going to the hanok village I don't think you'd want it. Figuring out gas stations was stressful; I was very grateful to have found a full service S-OIL station in Jeju and I'd recommend using full service stations if you're vacationing. Driving culture wasn't terribly different, though the race from speed camera to speed camera took some adjustment.

Booking a taxi was stressful. I only did it once, leaving Busan KTX station. The actual booking via Kakao T was fine, although they only let me book the ""black"" service so it wasn't cheap. There are two taxi stands there at opposite sides of the station, and I went to the wrong one. The driver kept texting me and calling me telling me to hurry, even though he had arrived 10 minutes before the scheduled pickup time. I didn't understand Korean well enough to understand where he said he was parked. It didn't feel great.

For excursions far outside the cities (Everland, Gyeongju, etc.) it seemed well worth my time to just book a tour instead of navigating public transportation. It was much faster and simpler (no transfers to worry about). If I was on a tighter budget I would've been fine with public transportation, but it would've taken about 50% longer. Part of this decision was that the tour pickup spots were VERY close to my hotels (Myeongdong and Haeundae) so keep that in mind - staying in the tourist hot spots does have some additional advantages for planning.

**Language**

Learn to read Hangul. Learn the names of Korean dishes. That's the biggest bang for your buck.

I've been studying Korean via apps for about 4 years in preparation for this trip. I can read pretty easily. I can formulate both simple and complex sentences to communicate my needs. But boy, I really really struggled with listening comprehension with native speakers. They were always delighted and pleasantly surprised to hear me speak Korean, and praised my pronunciation, but I just couldn't keep up with the flow of conversation and that had me a little sad. I never felt that it was strictly necessary. I always had Papago to fall back on (another reason to have data service), and there were plenty of people who knew enough English to get by. I was always able to communicate my needs in some way.

Counter service restaurant ordering is wonderful. It's usually via kiosk, and the kiosk almost always has an option to switch to English. These were primarily cafes and dessert locations.

**Lodging**

I took care to try to get a variety of different hotel options (traditional hotel, hanok stay, wellness resort, apartment) and we really enjoyed having that variety. It made every location feel more unique and special.

**Overall**

I was very pleased with how this itinerary worked out and would recommend something similar. I could've done another day on Jeju, probably in exchange for one of the Seoul days. But I don't regret how it all worked out. We got a nice variety of experiences across some key areas of the country. We had a few home bases that we could really get familiar with and settle into. I felt like I had overplanned for this vacation, but all the planning worked out. When things needed to change, I always had a backup plan or knew of another possible solution. I felt generally confident about the details of this trip, which was great because some of the details were stressful in the moment. It all worked out, people were very kind and accommodating, and we had a magical time. That’s too bad you guys didn’t go to spa land. They really don’t care about tattoos despite what the sign says.

It wasn’t on my radar, but sometimes the best adventures come from the least expected places. I went with friends, and Yecheon turned out to be an unforgettable experience.



**Mungyeong Saejae (문경새재): Like a K-Drama Set**

Walking through this historic pass felt like stepping into a K-drama (fun fact! Mungyeong Saejae was actually one of the locations when ‘Alchemy of Souls’ and ‘Kingdom’ was filmed :D). To make things fun, we gave ourselves little missions along the way, turning sightseeing into an adventure. We stumbled upon a traditional tea ceremony and learned the art of Korean tea-making. It was such a peaceful setting and the perfect break from lots of walking.

**Fun Episodes with Locals**

In a small island village, we found ourselves waiting for a big Korean family to cross a narrow bridge. Instead of standing around, we started clapping and cheering them on. They laughed, we laughed, and that tiny moment became one of our funniest memories.



**Yecheon Star Park**

Yecheon has one of Korea’s best stargazing spots, which is the Yecheon Star Park. With zero light pollution, the night sky was unreal. If you visit, do not miss this! It’s indeed truly breathtaking.



**Food? Absolutely Delicious**

Btw Yecheon is famous for its rice, and trust me, you can taste the difference! We had Yecheon-style chicken porridge after a long day, and it hit the spot. Their apples? Next level. Super crisp and sweet. I really recommend you try the fresh apple juice while you're here!



**Why You Should Go!!**

Yecheon isn’t the most well-known travel spot, but that’s what makes it special. Whether it’s hiking Mungyeong Saejae, making new friends, stargazing, or devouring amazing food, Yecheon is a hidden gem worth visiting.

📍 **Location**: Gangnam Station Branch (강남역점) 

🍗 Why You’ll Love It: 

* Specializes in Korean-style chicken wings & boneless chicken. 
* Best place to enjoy crispy fried chicken with **locally brewed craft beer**. 
* Great vibe for a night out with friends, especially if you want to experience Korea’s Chimaek culture. 

✅ Must-Try: Their signature boneless spicy chicken + a pint of Korean craft beer! 🍻 

✅Saenghwal Maekju (Living Beer) has multiple locations, but the Gangnam Station branch is one of the easiest to find. What makes this spot special is its wide variety of craft beers, making it the perfect place to pair different beers with crispy fried chicken! 🍻 I used to go here for a post-work chimaek (chicken & beer) session all the time, and it never disappointed! 😊

",35,Suggestions,"Namsam Tower is N Seoul Tower, by the way | After Insadong, should add Gwanghamun Square, then Bosingak Bell, then Lotte Department Main Store in Myeongdong - they're along the same route. | **Taxi Fare** ([per Visit Korea](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/infoBscView.do?vcontsId=140661) last updated August 2024)

Taxi fare varies by city and taxi type. Most taxis charge passengers the sum of the base fare and additional charges based on the traveled distance. Additional charges may apply depending on time and driving out of the region. Late-night fare is usually applied from 22:00 to 04:00 with the surcharge varying in amount depending on the time. The late-night fare is most expensive from 23:00 to 02:00.     

Based on regular taxis, the base fare is the most expensive in Seoul at 4,800 won. Base fares in other regions are 4,000 won in Daegu and Ulsan; 3,800 won in Gyeonggi-do, Incheon, Busan, and Gangwon State; and 3,300 won in Gwangju, Daejeon, and Jeju. The base fare is applied to a traveled distance within 2 kilometers, and additional charges apply for every traveled distance beyond that. The additional surcharge also varies by region but can be estimated to be 100 won for every 130\~150 meters.     

The base fare for deluxe taxis is 7,000 won in Seoul for traveling within a 3-kilometer distance. An additional surcharge is 200 won for every 151 meters. Different standards may apply depending on the taxi company, and therefore travelers are advised to check in advance.      

International taxis operate on a different fare system from standard taxis. When traveling from the airport to Seoul, passengers are charged based on a fare table categorized by regional sections. If you’re taking an international taxi to travel within Seoul or leave Seoul, you will be charged by the meter with a 20% surcharge.      

(Maximum surcharge of 60% can be charged for late-night hour fare between 22:00 and 04:00 and driving out of the region)

**Call Taxi**

If you want to save time or hailing a taxi is not an option, you can use a call taxi service. You can either call a call taxi directly or use an app to have the taxi come to your location. Apps are usually the most convenient way to call a taxi since you can check the fare estimate in advance. Note that you may have to pay a small fee for using the call service charge apart from your taxi fare.     

Alternatively, you can use a taxi-hailing app called k.ride. Operated by Kakao Mobility, k.ride is a foreigner-exclusive version of Kakao T. k.ride is available in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and it’s much more accessible by non-residents of Korea as it allows social login via Google or Apple and accepts overseas credit card registration as a payment method. 

Related news: [Calling a Cab is Now Easier with k.ride](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?menuSn=177&vcontsId=198416)

You can also use Uber in Korea, although the app can either go by the name Uber or UT in Korea depending on your mobile OS. UT is a Korean navigation program that collaborated with Uber to release a Korea-exclusive call taxi app. UT is compatible with the Uber app that is already installed in a device so there’s no need to change any settings if you are already an Uber user.     

KakaoT, also known as Kakao Taxi, is the most prevalent taxi app in Korea, but you need a Kakao account. KakaoT offers an option for the passenger to pay directly to the driver using their preferred payment method so there’s no need to register your credit card. | Sundubu Jjigae - tofu stew - if you want to eat at a popular type of restaurant that serves tofu.

1esozth,"Traveling from Busan to Fukuoka by Camellia Line Ferry 

",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1esozth/traveling_from_busan_to_fukuoka_by_camellia_line/,1723706424.0,"I recently traveled from Busan to Fukuoka by ferry, and I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering the same route. 

Booking the Tickets:  
Finding tickets that weren't part of tour packages on Korean sites was a challenge. Buying directly from the Camellia Line Ferry wasn’t an option either, as all the second-class (the cheapest, shared rooms) tickets were sold out. Eventually, I purchased my tickets from \[12go.asia\](https://12go.asia/en), but it took days for them to confirm, which was incredibly stressful. I kept messaging and emailing them until they finally confirmed.

Arriving at Busan Port:

At Busan stations you can follow the signs to the port. If you arrive early and want to explore Busan without your luggage, there’s a place to store it at the port. Just be aware that it closes around 12 PM for about an hour for a lunch break.  
The ticket advised arriving 3 hours before departure, but we arrived about 1.5 hours before boarding. Check-in was pretty fast, almost like an airport. One important thing to remember: bring your passport and if you have an Arc good to have that too. After checking in, there’s a small coffee shop and a duty-free shop, but don’t expect well-known brands—it seemed like mostly in-house brands

Boarding the Ferry:

When boarding started, people rushed to get to their rooms—probably to secure spots in the lounge areas. I was in second class, which means sleeping on the floor in a Japanese-style setup. There was one outlet in my room and the tv outlets. It uses outlets for Japan so I suggest buying an adapter/converter at Daiso. I am from Canada so my chargers and hair straighter worked fine. The pillows they provide are brick-shaped and quite hard, so if you need a proper pillow, I highly suggest bringing your own if you are in Second class. The room I was in had about 10 people, and while the rooms are generally gender-segregated, I did see some rooms accommodating couples or families.

The ferry has a cafeteria, some vending machines, and an open-style bathroom with a small bath. Many passengers brought their own food, like pizza and chicken, and ate in the cafeteria. The showers and the small convenience store onboard close once the ferry starts moving around 11 PM, and the cafeteria might close too. Also, note that only Japanese yen is accepted on the ferry, and during my trip, the card machines weren’t working due to bad weather. Definitely bring cash! Another thing to note: there is no Wi-Fi on board, so I had my shows downloaded.

The ride to Fukuoka was honestly the worst ferry ride I’ve ever been on. The boat was rocking so much that it was difficult to walk, and I felt dizzy most of the time—I held onto the wall for support. My stomach felt like it was on a roller coaster. On the way back, though, it was a completely different story. The ride was so smooth I couldn’t even feel the boat moving. I strongly suggest bringing motion sickness medicine just in case. Both trips my friend slept through the whole entry thing and said it was super comfortable.

In the morning, the showers open for a limited time, so if you want to use them, it’s a good idea to line up early. You can also buy Korean or Japanese style breakfast. Also, the ferry doesn’t provide free toothbrushes or other toiletries, so make sure to bring your own.

One of the highlights of the trip was making a new friend on the ferry. We shared some chicken and chatted before heading to our rooms to sleep. The ferry also has a small arcade and karaoke rooms, which added to the fun.

Immigration at Fukuoka was surprisingly fast because I lined up with my luggage to get off the ferry first. I put my luggage on the second floor in front of the exit door, which many other passengers did as well. However, returning to Korea took much longer, as Korean immigration seemed to be more thorough.

Once you arrive in Fukuoka, you can buy a bus card at the port and even an eSIM from a vending machine. If you're an iPhone user, you can also buy a bus card through an app. For those with phones that support eSIM, I recommend purchasing one from an app like Airalo. There’s a bus right at the port that takes you straight to Hakata Station for around 250 yen.

I hope my experience was able to help anyone who was thinking of taking a ferry from Busan to Japan.

Edit : I wanted to add that I added Camilla Line Ferry one Line just to confirm if I was indeed a passenger because I was so nervous 12goasia was a scam. Which they did confirm and everything worked out. The great part of adding them on Line was that they were giving me updates on things with the Ferry that 12goasia did not do.",17,Trip Report!,"Is there a reason you pick this versus the JR Beetle?

1g8ru7k,Is it not common to take leftovers home from restaurants?,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1g8ru7k/is_it_not_common_to_take_leftovers_home_from/,1729523031.0,"I understand this might be a strange question but I've had this impression after my experience a few years ago when I visited Korea. My friends couldnt really answer or maybe they couldnt put it into words due to their limited English. But from what I've seen, we never take leftovers with us from restaurants. I know this isnt about me but it kind of drives me nuts to throw food away, especially for portions that are over a quarter or half sometimes. I've even seen it at other tables. 

I'm going back to Korea in a few months and hope to understand before I get weird looks since I am a solo traveling foodie. I expected to order food that might be portioned for family style (jokbal, fried chicken, jimdak, etc) but did not mind taking the rest back to my hotel. 

I dont mind ordering take out but I highly prefer it fresh and ready to be consumed on the spot. ",31,Food and Drink,"For *Korean* Korean foods where there are (unlimited) banchans, I would say they won't let you.

But for jokbal, fried chicken, jimdak, I think if you asked you could do it at most places..! I've done all those places, pork cutlet, sashimi, etc. | My Korean friend told me it’s totally OK to ask except banchan and taught me this expression 

남은 음식을 포장해 주세요

case by case though. (eg. not appropriate at fine dining) | The proliferation of delivery sales in recent years has in fact facilitated it.

In the bygone era, food delivery used to be fairly limited to Chinese food, pizza, chicken, and Jokbal/Bossam. Packing of leftovers wasn't the culture, thus not a usual business practice, therefore other categories of restaurants usually had no reason to even have takeaway containers on hand.

Ever since delivery apps have become popular, many places now have disposable containers available for delivery orders, which they can easily repurpose for packing leftovers if you ask. | I've actually noticed the same. I can't recall seeing someone take their leftovers home. In the US, this is very common and you see leftovers bagged up at tables all the time. 

But I've also taken left overs home here on many occasions and it has never been an issue. | OP, I also hate wasting food and usually bring home what I can. I've lived here for 6 years and seen MOST places will give you leftovers (agree-not extra side dishes, but main meal leftovers or they will let you take what's already on the table banchan-wise). I have found that a handful of places don't have containers--I've been given leftover soup in a plastic bag hahaha, but they were willing and tried to accommodate me. Only a few places have said ""no"" to taking leftovers and I think if I'd had a container myself, I could have taken it...they just honestly had nothing. <<that was my first year here in 2019 and I haven't had any place tell me 'no' since then. I think you'll have success!","Is it not common to take leftovers home from restaurants? I understand this might be a strange question but I've had this impression after my experience a few years ago when I visited Korea. My friends couldnt really answer or maybe they couldnt put it into words due to their limited English. But from what I've seen, we never take leftovers with us from restaurants. I know this isnt about me but it kind of drives me nuts to throw food away, especially for portions that are over a quarter or half sometimes. I've even seen it at other tables. 

I'm going back to Korea in a few months and hope to understand before I get weird looks since I am a solo traveling foodie. I expected to order food that might be portioned for family style (jokbal, fried chicken, jimdak, etc) but did not mind taking the rest back to my hotel. 

I dont mind ordering take out but I highly prefer it fresh and ready to be consumed on the spot.  For *Korean* Korean foods where there are (unlimited) banchans, I would say they won't let you.

But for jokbal, fried chicken, jimdak, I think if you asked you could do it at most places..! I've done all those places, pork cutlet, sashimi, etc. | My Korean friend told me it’s totally OK to ask except banchan and taught me this expression 

남은 음식을 포장해 주세요

case by case though. (eg. not appropriate at fine dining) | The proliferation of delivery sales in recent years has in fact facilitated it.

In the bygone era, food delivery used to be fairly limited to Chinese food, pizza, chicken, and Jokbal/Bossam. Packing of leftovers wasn't the culture, thus not a usual business practice, therefore other categories of restaurants usually had no reason to even have takeaway containers on hand.

Ever since delivery apps have become popular, many places now have disposable containers available for delivery orders, which they can easily repurpose for packing leftovers if you ask. | I've actually noticed the same. I can't recall seeing someone take their leftovers home. In the US, this is very common and you see leftovers bagged up at tables all the time. 

But I've also taken left overs home here on many occasions and it has never been an issue. | OP, I also hate wasting food and usually bring home what I can. I've lived here for 6 years and seen MOST places will give you leftovers (agree-not extra side dishes, but main meal leftovers or they will let you take what's already on the table banchan-wise). I have found that a handful of places don't have containers--I've been given leftover soup in a plastic bag hahaha, but they were willing and tried to accommodate me. Only a few places have said ""no"" to taking leftovers and I think if I'd had a container myself, I could have taken it...they just honestly had nothing. <<that was my first year here in 2019 and I haven't had any place tell me 'no' since then.

Fun facts up front:

* Used Ubigi eSIM with no issues
* Used USA Visa credit cards and VISA debit cards at ATMs everywhere with only one issue out of dozens of purchases
* Apps needed: Naver Map, Kakao T, T-locker luggage storage, Klook, Asiana

# Days 1-5: Seoul

We arrived arrived to ICN from the USA around 06:30 local time. Collected bags and got T-money cards for 4000krw each from the CU convenience store in Terminal 1 at ICN. We then got a Kakao T taxi called a “Venti” (which is a 6-seater van with plenty of room for 4 people and luggage, thankyou Reddit) and got to our Airbnb apartment in Myeongdong (on the lower slopes of Mt Namsan, essentially) to wash up and nap for a couple hours.

Hungry, we walked down to the main part of Myeongdong and hopped in a short-ish line, about 20 minutes, at Myeongdong Kyoja. This was 100% worth the short wait as the food is incredible and the service is smooth and efficient. My kids didn’t find it spicy or weird and OH MY GOD the kimchi here is so incredibly delicious and garlicky.

We then wandered around central Myeongdong for some window shopping and fun. Grabbed coffee at UPND cafe (aka “Eopendeu”) which served a very good “third-wave” style Chemex pourover coffee and desserts. Then we ran into the dancing cat mascot for Cat Cafe Sarangchae. Sarangchae was a very good and reasonably priced cat cafe, with hot espresso drinks, with nice decor and good spacing of clients, though the cats were fairly chill and not terribly playful or cuddly. I headed over to Davich Optical to see about getting prescription sunglasses - they said my high prescription would take 4-5 days - while the rest of the family shopped and got caricatures, which is very much a thing in the touristy parts of Seoul and Korea generally it seems. We grabbed dinner at Sushiro near the Myeongdong Cathedral, which leaves something to be desired for quantity/quality but kaitensushi is my kids’ absolute favorite so all were reasonably happy. We strolled a bit more and enjoyed the very Christmas-y vibe - there is a big tree right in front of the Myeongdong Theater and lots of gift-y / Christmas-y ads on the giant screen at the Shinsegae department store. We saw quite a bit of the anti-president protests going on along the main thoroughfare Namdaemun-ro before heading back for the evening.

**Day 2** \- the weather forecast looked decent today so we wanted to spend it actively without overexerting ourself re: jetlag. But we very much overexerted ourselves anyway! We took the metro over to DDP for an art installation called Immersive-K which is one of those digital art shows, with the nice and artistic wrinkle of it being inspired by traditional Korean art and visual motifs. The show runs until April 2025, and being there right when it opened, we were the only ones inside! Highly recommend. My kids also got to play the outdoor piano in DDP which they loved.

Next we checked out the Sparex jjimjilbang across from DDP in the “Good Morning City” building, level B3. This worked out really well for our family and we were not the only (Western) tourists there. While the sauna/coed section was not my favorite – felt like I was constantly third-wheeling couple sitting together on their phones in the saunas (!) - the sex-separate baths area was really great and refreshing and overall well worth the 12000krw. My wife got a body scrub and we all had lunch here, which was one of the more legit Korean meals we had in Seoul, served by a couple older ladies, with the soft tofu stew being spicy as hell and lots of panchan.

We then grabbed a taxi (our first of many) over to the Nanta show in Myeongdong. Interesting that this was basically the most expensive attraction we did the whole trip - a ticket is about 50,000krw while that is also what admission to Lotte World Adventure costs. The show itself was great but probably best for kids age 4-12, with lots of goofy physical humor and nonverbal comedy to go with dancing and music. Older kids (or cynical adults) will probably find it a little “broad” or childish. My kids absolutely loved it.

The weather was cooperative (50s, clear) so we walked up Namsan Mountain. The walk from central Myeongdong (say, the station, or Shinsegae dept store) is only about 45 minutes. It was crisp and clear at the top for sunset and photos and we got the cable car back down. We finished off the night with some street food in the central part of Myeongdong, with my kids and I agreeing that (overpriced, I’m sure) gimbap is amazing. The mandu stands there I found pretty tasty and there were plenty of seafood options for my wife.

**Day 3** \- My wife planned to have some “me time” in the morning in Gangnam and my kids love books and reading, so the Coex Mall / Starfield Library was a natural destination. It was pleasantly uncrowded at \~11am and has several nice coffee and chocolate shops there. It’s just kind of wild that the centerpoint of a giant mall in a giant city is a literal library; this is unfathomable in the USA (not that we really have malls anymore anyway).

The Coex mall has a bunch of nice shopping stores, mostly brands etc, as well as a Gundam store (yasss) and at least one arcade (Fun City) on the basement level. Fun City had a variety of games that were mostly 1,000krw a play including dancing and shooting games and no hassle with using a payment card. There are also 4 coin noraebang stalls in this arcade so if you are in this area of Gangnam and want to do low-hassle, no-alcohol, kid-friendly noraebang, that’s a good option. We grabbed lunch at a Jeonju Bibimbap in the restaurant “street” on B1F where there were a number of tourist- and kid-friendly restaurants.

Wanting to branch out a bit from Myeongdong, we took the Metro over to Insadong primarily to check out the Dynamic Maze and Jogyesa. My kids loved the Dynamic Maze and actually begged to go back in the days that followed - interestingly, one of the Klook Seoul passes allows unlimited return visits, but we didn’t have it - but it’s not very unique or special, just that it’s the kind of thing that kids love in general. Jogyesa was very beautiful after dark and we strolled along the Insadong “culture street” with the craft shops.

We met back up with my wife in Myeongdong and then I got my “me time” of chimaek. I went to the BHC in Myeongdong, which is in a cluster of restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk which seemed to me one of the only outdoor dining options around and has kind of a beer garden feel. I did my best to polish off a platter of BHC chicken (half original, half sauced) with a liter+ of beer and had a great time people watching. BHC was full of larger groups but also kids and families with small children so at least this particular location in central Myeongdong is family friendly, to be expected. Also, the serving of chicken is obviously too much for one person, more meant for 2-4 people at least, but that’s obvious based on the fact it’s like 12 pieces of chicken. All joined up, we went to Skycat Cafe and while it was enjoyable it was a smaller operation with no hot drinks (vs Sarangchae) so I could not highly recommend it.

**Day 4** \- Today was Lotte World / Jamsil day, and a rainy and cold day in the 40’s. We got a taxi from Myeongdong to a building right next to Lotte World Adventure, to get gyobok (the school uniforms) to go into LWA. We somehow ended up in a different building than the one I was intending (trying to find Ehwa) but ran into a shop with two friendly older guys simply called “Seoul School Uniform” in B1-17 of the building 2 buildings west of Lotte World that was zero wait, zero hassle. At 66,000krw for the 4 of us that felt like a good price and we were on our way. (For what it’s worth, the gyobok place right across from the B1F main entrance of LWA was absolutely crushed at 10-11am). 

LWA was a mixed experience for sure. As many have said, it was very crowded, even though we got there around 11am on a weekday, and it got crazy crowded in the afternoon, presumably as teens showed up after school. The reservation system for certain rides was confusing, i.e., there was literally no way it could or would be explained to us. We chose not to get the Magic Pass or whatever it’s called based on the outdoor rides being closed and our kids not being tall enough for one of the roller coasters. We did get our tickets on Klook with the combo ticket for Seoul Sky - this was an easy win.

Our first ride was Drunken Baskets. I can’t tell you how much of a mistake this was. I was nauseous for literally hours after this thing and it ruined half my day. I’m not prone to motion sickness but holy hell. Next we did the haunted house which a) costs extra money and b) isn’t good. I basically had to ditch my family to get some sugar and hydration in me to deal with nausea. Fly Venture was fun but again did not help the situation, and I ditched my family again to go to Mr. Pork for a Namsan tonkatsu, which was delicious. They did the hot air balloon and a hilarious Christmas parade took place (imagine Korean Santa booming, “HAPPY CHRISTMAS!”). Ultimately my kids did some bumper cars, the merry-go-round, and got turned away at (I believe) Kidstoria for being too tall. We got some souvenirs and got outta there. So yes, very much the mixed experience, made worse by crowds, that I was told would happen.

We got ourselves over to Seoul Sky next, which was really fantastic. There was no line to get in and soon we were up on the 120th floor for the views, cafe, and the open-to-all piano. Cool experience, my kids loved the glass floor looking down 1000+ feet.

Our family split up at this point, because I had secured a ticket to a performance at the music hall (Namsan Gugakdang) at Namsangol Hanok Village to see a type of music I wasn’t familiar with, a kut / sanjo / sinawi performance billed as an “exorcism” and played by a \~8 person ensemble. It was a very cool experience and I highly recommend checking out the website for NHV ahead of time for events like this. The pieces were introduced in Korean but I had done a little research on kut and some of the instruments ahead of time and used Google Translate on the program provided so I had some general idea of what was going on. I do believe I was the only tourist at this thing, and the audience response was rapturous.

(Tangent - I couldn’t buy a ticket on Naver because foreigner, so days before the show I went to the actual music hall to do so. The staff there couldn’t sell me a ticket either because it was some kind of one-off, third-party-hosted event. They said to call, and I couldn’t because no local phone number. They called for me, and no response. So, and all this being done via Google Translate, the staffer asked for my email and they would try to connect me to the booking office. An hour later, I got an email “Hello sir we have heard you would like a ticket to the Yoon Ho-Se performance, we will reserve one for you, thank you.” Amazingly kind and friendly!!!)

All the while my family, who had queued up in a VERY long line at the Gatten Sushi place in the Lotte Mall in Jamsil (the whole place was slammed at dinnertime) ultimately got bibimbap while I got samgyetang, which I did not really care for, but hot soup while a cold rain fell outside was well worth it.

# Days 5-8 - Seoul to Golgulsa and Gyeongju and back

The cold rain overnight turned into snow, and Seoul ended up getting a November-record \~6” of snow. This rendered Seoul quite beautiful, and logistically mostly figured for us as we needed to get to Seoul Station for a KTX train to Gyeongju en route to Golgulsa in the late morning. The taxi situation was nonexistent and we ended up taking the Metro which was not too crowded at 10am (plus it’s only 2 stops and no transfer from Myeongdong so…duh).

As we were returning to Seoul Station in 72h, we stashed some of our luggage using “T-locker” which is the default locker provider in the stations there. The other luggage services (Bounce, Radical, Storr, etc) seemed inconvenient and the same price so other than needing an app for T-locker it was quite easy. (For what it’s worth, it’s 24,000krw a day for a large luggage locker which is one of the few “expensive” things in Seoul!). Grabbed some coffee and gimbap before the train. I checked with the station agent that the QR code on my phone was sufficient for our tickets, but in the roundtrip journey from Seoul to Gyeongju no one checked our tickets once. So that is very cool.

Arriving to Singyeongju station, we grabbed udon soup lunch at one of the small restaurants there and took at 45-minute, 52,000krw taxi ride to Golgulsa.

Our 2-night Temple Stay experience at Golgulsa Buddhist Temple was wonderful and a highlight of our trip. I’ll link to my TripAdvisor review [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297888-d3629968-Reviews-Golgulsa_Temple-Gyeongju_Gyeongsangbuk_do.html) and sum up here. This was a great experience for solo or group or family travelers. It’s a tourist-facing but not “dumbed down” experience in my opinion and the agenda/itinerary gives you free time and some flexibility with what you would like to do or achieve. I.e., it was not “boot camp” in the sense of being forced to do anything, but also some of the things offered or expected of us were literally quite difficult like the 108 prostrations. The food was delicious and obviously vegetarian. I would definitely say the overnight stay is well worth it, and that we did get a lot out of the second day+night as well as the sessions, even if “every day is the same,” go differently depending on who and how family people are there and what the group would like to do or achieve. The principles of temple life (quiet, timeliness, calmness, eating everything on your plate and cleaning up) were shared and that was a very cool and very valuable experience for my kids. We spent a fair amount of time with Master Tao, an enigmatic man who was our main point of contact and the best English speaker around. We did the tea session, multiple sunmudo sessions, and the orientation sessions with him. He is an interesting and thoughtful and also funny person and someone I will not forget soon. One tip - bring cash to pay for your temple stay! My main credit card did not work here even though it worked everywhere else in Korea, luckily my 2nd one worked.

On our third day at Golgulsa, we packed up after lunch and got a 30-minute, 30,000krw taxi to Gyeongju. The Hotel Palace (bookable on Chase Points!) was a nice place with good breakfast and laundry and a comfortable 2-queen-bed room, very close to the central market and just a few blocks from Geumgwanchong. They did not let us check in early but we left our luggage with them and went out to explore.

Gyeongju is a lovely city. It is small and feels manageable, and the city and region/country have clearly been pumping money into tourism development here as you can see at the Geumgwanchong “museum” (which is excellent!) and Silla Dynasty Tombs Information Center.

Lonely Planet says the Gyeongju National Museum is “possibly the best in the country” and I think that has to be right. It’s free, it’s multilingual, and the content is very interesting. The plaza between the main exhibition hall and cafe building is lovely and the Ediya cafe has a great view overlooking the valley. Plus, there is a children’s museum targeted for age 3-9 I believe that has great activities and play spaces and is also free.

We got over to Donggung Palace aka Wolji Pond aka Anapji just at dusk - they actually post what time the lights come on - and although this is not an excellent historically-presented site, the beauty of the pond and buildings and lights can’t be understated. It’s lovely, and open until 10pm!

Having eaten vegetarian Buddhist food for 3 days, we wanted some comfort food, and were directed by Reddit to check out a Neapolitan pizza place “DOMI” which, holy hell, is legit Neapolitan pizza presumably 0-0 flour and a proper hot oven. Don’t miss this one. We then walked around some of the tombs areas which are stunning all lit up and down to the busy shopping and eating street Hwangnidan-gil. A lot of the development in this area looks new and I hope Gyeongju is just at the beginning of a glow-up.

The next morning, we had our hotel’s breakfast - I finally tried Busan style fish cake on a stick, not my thing at all - and walked around the tomb areas by daylight. As said above, the Geumgwanchong museum was awesome, though Cheonmachong (the only mound you can go in) is totally unnecessary after going to the National Museum. We grabbed lunch at Daewha Mandu which was great, walked past the observatory and Woljeonggyo bridge, and just thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and culture of Gyeongju. 

We got a taxi to the KTX back to Seoul, where, Saturday protests and drizzly rain snarled traffic, and it took us about an hour to go 3km in a taxi from Seoul Station to Anguk area! We checked into our hanok just outside of Bukchon Hanok Village and strolled down to Insadong. The kaitensushi at Ian Sushi in the Anyoung Insadong mall was good-not-great, and we window shopped and called it a night.

# Days 9-10 - Seoul and home

We were staying in Insadong / Anguk area but I had to pick up my glasses from Davich Optical down in Myeongdong so I jogged across town for a little exercise + errand. Ironically enough our day brought us back to Myeongdong so it was an effort for nothing but maybe highlights how central Myeongdong is.

We got coffee at Fritz Coffee Wonseo, in the Arario Museum front courtyard, which has a lovely seating area in (I think) an old hanok but the coffee was just-ok. We took the metro over to Gyeongbokgung for the day’s highlight, renting hanbok and strolling the palace for photos. The dressup experience was a huge amount of fun for my kids and in the palace we had so many friendly folks approaching us to offer to take photos of us as a family or in some cases, to get pictures WITH us! We rented from “Yes Hanbok” which was something like 30,000krw each so the whole “renting a hanbok is 5,000 won” angle wasn’t quite right.

We were hungry and still needed to do KBBQ in Seoul so we took a taxi down to Myeongdong to go to Daol BBQ specifically. This is a very touristy spot and not the best choice, but the quality of the meat seemed very high, and they did have seafood pancake for my wife although it was just meh. KBBQ in general is so much more expensive than most other foods in Korea, understandably, with the meal for 4 being about 150,000krw.

We did some souvenir shopping, stopping into one of the many Olive Youngs in the area and finding multiple Kpop souvenir stands in the Myeongdong Underground Shopping Center. We made our way back to Insadong for some more ceramic and craft shopping and there was street food stalls with basic food out as well as the many cafes along “Insadong Culture Street” and the malls nearby. Ultimately we got a very excellent dinner at Orena Ramen which was legit Tokyo Station Ramen Street quality and only a short wait, would highly recommend.

Our last day in Seoul we had a few hours to kill before an afternoon flight home and our Airbnb host was very kind to allow us to check out at 1pm. We got coffee and pastries at Hollow Cafe which is fun (and huge!) and strolled the Bukchon Hanok Village, which is crammed with folks angling for photos as well as some sort of film or TV or commercial shoot going on. We grabbed ice cream at Beurre Beurre, hopped in a Venti Kakao taxi back to ICN, and used Priority Pass access to the Asiana lounge to chill before the long flight home.

Lessons learned:

* English was very widely spoken here and only a couple times did we use Google Translate
* Credit cards were used almost everywhere, except some street stalls so it's useful to have 20-50k krw on you
* Taxis in central Seoul were cheap and easy way to get around, outside of rush hours and protests
* Only headache was dealing with the Naver / Google Map / Kakao issue of routefinding and choosing a taxi destination. Naver gives you everything in English, which Kakao T doesn't want, and their search functions are poor.
* People were generally friendly and welcoming to tourists and kids
* Seoul easily held our attention with attractions and activities for 6-7 days
* Buddhist Temple Stay was a trip (and lifetime) highlight experience, highly recommend",7,Trip Report,"Great trip report.

Hungry, we walked down to the main part of Myeongdong and hopped in a short-ish line, about 20 minutes, at Myeongdong Kyoja. This was 100% worth the short wait as the food is incredible and the service is smooth and efficient. My kids didn’t find it spicy or weird and OH MY GOD the kimchi here is so incredibly delicious and garlicky.

We then wandered around central Myeongdong for some window shopping and fun. Grabbed coffee at UPND cafe (aka “Eopendeu”) which served a very good “third-wave” style Chemex pourover coffee and desserts. Then we ran into the dancing cat mascot for Cat Cafe Sarangchae. Sarangchae was a very good and reasonably priced cat cafe, with hot espresso drinks, with nice decor and good spacing of clients, though the cats were fairly chill and not terribly playful or cuddly. I headed over to Davich Optical to see about getting prescription sunglasses - they said my high prescription would take 4-5 days - while the rest of the family shopped and got caricatures, which is very much a thing in the touristy parts of Seoul and Korea generally it seems. We grabbed dinner at Sushiro near the Myeongdong Cathedral, which leaves something to be desired for quantity/quality but kaitensushi is my kids’ absolute favorite so all were reasonably happy. We strolled a bit more and enjoyed the very Christmas-y vibe - there is a big tree right in front of the Myeongdong Theater and lots of gift-y / Christmas-y ads on the giant screen at the Shinsegae department store. We saw quite a bit of the anti-president protests going on along the main thoroughfare Namdaemun-ro before heading back for the evening.

**Day 2** \- the weather forecast looked decent today so we wanted to spend it actively without overexerting ourself re: jetlag. But we very much overexerted ourselves anyway! We took the metro over to DDP for an art installation called Immersive-K which is one of those digital art shows, with the nice and artistic wrinkle of it being inspired by traditional Korean art and visual motifs. The show runs until April 2025, and being there right when it opened, we were the only ones inside! Highly recommend. My kids also got to play the outdoor piano in DDP which they loved.

Next we checked out the Sparex jjimjilbang across from DDP in the “Good Morning City” building, level B3. This worked out really well for our family and we were not the only (Western) tourists there. While the sauna/coed section was not my favorite – felt like I was constantly third-wheeling couple sitting together on their phones in the saunas (!) - the sex-separate baths area was really great and refreshing and overall well worth the 12000krw. My wife got a body scrub and we all had lunch here, which was one of the more legit Korean meals we had in Seoul, served by a couple older ladies, with the soft tofu stew being spicy as hell and lots of panchan.

We then grabbed a taxi (our first of many) over to the Nanta show in Myeongdong. Interesting that this was basically the most expensive attraction we did the whole trip - a ticket is about 50,000krw while that is also what admission to Lotte World Adventure costs. The show itself was great but probably best for kids age 4-12, with lots of goofy physical humor and nonverbal comedy to go with dancing and music. Older kids (or cynical adults) will probably find it a little “broad” or childish. My kids absolutely loved it.

The weather was cooperative (50s, clear) so we walked up Namsan Mountain. The walk from central Myeongdong (say, the station, or Shinsegae dept store) is only about 45 minutes. It was crisp and clear at the top for sunset and photos and we got the cable car back down. We finished off the night with some street food in the central part of Myeongdong, with my kids and I agreeing that (overpriced, I’m sure) gimbap is amazing. The mandu stands there I found pretty tasty and there were plenty of seafood options for my wife.

**Day 3** \- My wife planned to have some “me time” in the morning in Gangnam and my kids love books and reading, so the Coex Mall / Starfield Library was a natural destination. It was pleasantly uncrowded at \~11am and has several nice coffee and chocolate shops there. It’s just kind of wild that the centerpoint of a giant mall in a giant city is a literal library; this is unfathomable in the USA (not that we really have malls anymore anyway).

The Coex mall has a bunch of nice shopping stores, mostly brands etc, as well as a Gundam store (yasss) and at least one arcade (Fun City) on the basement level. Fun City had a variety of games that were mostly 1,000krw a play including dancing and shooting games and no hassle with using a payment card. There are also 4 coin noraebang stalls in this arcade so if you are in this area of Gangnam and want to do low-hassle, no-alcohol, kid-friendly noraebang, that’s a good option. We grabbed lunch at a Jeonju Bibimbap in the restaurant “street” on B1F where there were a number of tourist- and kid-friendly restaurants.

Wanting to branch out a bit from Myeongdong, we took the Metro over to Insadong primarily to check out the Dynamic Maze and Jogyesa. My kids loved the Dynamic Maze and actually begged to go back in the days that followed - interestingly, one of the Klook Seoul passes allows unlimited return visits, but we didn’t have it - but it’s not very unique or special, just that it’s the kind of thing that kids love in general. Jogyesa was very beautiful after dark and we strolled along the Insadong “culture street” with the craft shops.

We met back up with my wife in Myeongdong and then I got my “me time” of chimaek. I went to the BHC in Myeongdong, which is in a cluster of restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk which seemed to me one of the only outdoor dining options around and has kind of a beer garden feel. I did my best to polish off a platter of BHC chicken (half original, half sauced) with a liter+ of beer and had a great time people watching. BHC was full of larger groups but also kids and families with small children so at least this particular location in central Myeongdong is family friendly, to be expected. Also, the serving of chicken is obviously too much for one person, more meant for 2-4 people at least, but that’s obvious based on the fact it’s like 12 pieces of chicken. All joined up, we went to Skycat Cafe and while it was enjoyable it was a smaller operation with no hot drinks (vs Sarangchae) so I could not highly recommend it.

**Day 4** \- Today was Lotte World / Jamsil day, and a rainy and cold day in the 40’s. We got a taxi from Myeongdong to a building right next to Lotte World Adventure, to get gyobok (the school uniforms) to go into LWA. We somehow ended up in a different building than the one I was intending (trying to find Ehwa) but ran into a shop with two friendly older guys simply called “Seoul School Uniform” in B1-17 of the building 2 buildings west of Lotte World that was zero wait, zero hassle. At 66,000krw for the 4 of us that felt like a good price and we were on our way. (For what it’s worth, the gyobok place right across from the B1F main entrance of LWA was absolutely crushed at 10-11am). 

LWA was a mixed experience for sure. As many have said, it was very crowded, even though we got there around 11am on a weekday, and it got crazy crowded in the afternoon, presumably as teens showed up after school. The reservation system for certain rides was confusing, i.e., there was literally no way it could or would be explained to us. We chose not to get the Magic Pass or whatever it’s called based on the outdoor rides being closed and our kids not being tall enough for one of the roller coasters. We did get our tickets on Klook with the combo ticket for Seoul Sky - this was an easy win.

Our first ride was Drunken Baskets. I can’t tell you how much of a mistake this was. I was nauseous for literally hours after this thing and it ruined half my day. I’m not prone to motion sickness but holy hell. Next we did the haunted house which a) costs extra money and b) isn’t good. I basically had to ditch my family to get some sugar and hydration in me to deal with nausea. Fly Venture was fun but again did not help the situation, and I ditched my family again to go to Mr. Pork for a Namsan tonkatsu, which was delicious. They did the hot air balloon and a hilarious Christmas parade took place (imagine Korean Santa booming, “HAPPY CHRISTMAS!”). Ultimately my kids did some bumper cars, the merry-go-round, and got turned away at (I believe) Kidstoria for being too tall. We got some souvenirs and got outta there. So yes, very much the mixed experience, made worse by crowds, that I was told would happen.

We got ourselves over to Seoul Sky next, which was really fantastic. There was no line to get in and soon we were up on the 120th floor for the views, cafe, and the open-to-all piano. Cool experience, my kids loved the glass floor looking down 1000+ feet.

Our family split up at this point, because I had secured a ticket to a performance at the music hall (Namsan Gugakdang) at Namsangol Hanok Village to see a type of music I wasn’t familiar with, a kut / sanjo / sinawi performance billed as an “exorcism” and played by a \~8 person ensemble. It was a very cool experience and I highly recommend checking out the website for NHV ahead of time for events like this. The pieces were introduced in Korean but I had done a little research on kut and some of the instruments ahead of time and used Google Translate on the program provided so I had some general idea of what was going on. I do believe I was the only tourist at this thing, and the audience response was rapturous.

(Tangent - I couldn’t buy a ticket on Naver because foreigner, so days before the show I went to the actual music hall to do so. The staff there couldn’t sell me a ticket either because it was some kind of one-off, third-party-hosted event. They said to call, and I couldn’t because no local phone number. They called for me, and no response. So, and all this being done via Google Translate, the staffer asked for my email and they would try to connect me to the booking office. An hour later, I got an email “Hello sir we have heard you would like a ticket to the Yoon Ho-Se performance, we will reserve one for you, thank you.” Amazingly kind and friendly!!!)

All the while my family, who had queued up in a VERY long line at the Gatten Sushi place in the Lotte Mall in Jamsil (the whole place was slammed at dinnertime) ultimately got bibimbap while I got samgyetang, which I did not really care for, but hot soup while a cold rain fell outside was well worth it.

# Days 5-8 - Seoul to Golgulsa and Gyeongju and back

The cold rain overnight turned into snow, and Seoul ended up getting a November-record \~6” of snow. This rendered Seoul quite beautiful, and logistically mostly figured for us as we needed to get to Seoul Station for a KTX train to Gyeongju en route to Golgulsa in the late morning. The taxi situation was nonexistent and we ended up taking the Metro which was not too crowded at 10am (plus it’s only 2 stops and no transfer from Myeongdong so…duh).

As we were returning to Seoul Station in 72h, we stashed some of our luggage using “T-locker” which is the default locker provider in the stations there. The other luggage services (Bounce, Radical, Storr, etc) seemed inconvenient and the same price so other than needing an app for T-locker it was quite easy. (For what it’s worth, it’s 24,000krw a day for a large luggage locker which is one of the few “expensive” things in Seoul!). Grabbed some coffee and gimbap before the train. I checked with the station agent that the QR code on my phone was sufficient for our tickets, but in the roundtrip journey from Seoul to Gyeongju no one checked our tickets once. So that is very cool.

Arriving to Singyeongju station, we grabbed udon soup lunch at one of the small restaurants there and took at 45-minute, 52,000krw taxi ride to Golgulsa.

Our 2-night Temple Stay experience at Golgulsa Buddhist Temple was wonderful and a highlight of our trip. I’ll link to my TripAdvisor review [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297888-d3629968-Reviews-Golgulsa_Temple-Gyeongju_Gyeongsangbuk_do.html) and sum up here. This was a great experience for solo or group or family travelers. It’s a tourist-facing but not “dumbed down” experience in my opinion and the agenda/itinerary gives you free time and some flexibility with what you would like to do or achieve. I.e., it was not “boot camp” in the sense of being forced to do anything, but also some of the things offered or expected of us were literally quite difficult like the 108 prostrations. The food was delicious and obviously vegetarian. I would definitely say the overnight stay is well worth it, and that we did get a lot out of the second day+night as well as the sessions, even if “every day is the same,” go differently depending on who and how family people are there and what the group would like to do or achieve. The principles of temple life (quiet, timeliness, calmness, eating everything on your plate and cleaning up) were shared and that was a very cool and very valuable experience for my kids. We spent a fair amount of time with Master Tao, an enigmatic man who was our main point of contact and the best English speaker around. We did the tea session, multiple sunmudo sessions, and the orientation sessions with him. He is an interesting and thoughtful and also funny person and someone I will not forget soon. One tip - bring cash to pay for your temple stay! My main credit card did not work here even though it worked everywhere else in Korea, luckily my 2nd one worked.

On our third day at Golgulsa, we packed up after lunch and got a 30-minute, 30,000krw taxi to Gyeongju. The Hotel Palace (bookable on Chase Points!) was a nice place with good breakfast and laundry and a comfortable 2-queen-bed room, very close to the central market and just a few blocks from Geumgwanchong. They did not let us check in early but we left our luggage with them and went out to explore.

Gyeongju is a lovely city. It is small and feels manageable, and the city and region/country have clearly been pumping money into tourism development here as you can see at the Geumgwanchong “museum” (which is excellent!) and Silla Dynasty Tombs Information Center.

Lonely Planet says the Gyeongju National Museum is “possibly the best in the country” and I think that has to be right. It’s free, it’s multilingual, and the content is very interesting. The plaza between the main exhibition hall and cafe building is lovely and the Ediya cafe has a great view overlooking the valley. Plus, there is a children’s museum targeted for age 3-9 I believe that has great activities and play spaces and is also free.

We got over to Donggung Palace aka Wolji Pond aka Anapji just at dusk - they actually post what time the lights come on - and although this is not an excellent historically-presented site, the beauty of the pond and buildings and lights can’t be understated. It’s lovely, and open until 10pm!

Having eaten vegetarian Buddhist food for 3 days, we wanted some comfort food, and were directed by Reddit to check out a Neapolitan pizza place “DOMI” which, holy hell, is legit Neapolitan pizza presumably 0-0 flour and a proper hot oven. Don’t miss this one. We then walked around some of the tombs areas which are stunning all lit up and down to the busy shopping and eating street Hwangnidan-gil. A lot of the development in this area looks new and I hope Gyeongju is just at the beginning of a glow-up.

The next morning, we had our hotel’s breakfast - I finally tried Busan style fish cake on a stick, not my thing at all - and walked around the tomb areas by daylight. As said above, the Geumgwanchong museum was awesome, though Cheonmachong (the only mound you can go in) is totally unnecessary after going to the National Museum. We grabbed lunch at Daewha Mandu which was great, walked past the observatory and Woljeonggyo bridge, and just thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and culture of Gyeongju. 

We got a taxi to the KTX back to Seoul, where, Saturday protests and drizzly rain snarled traffic, and it took us about an hour to go 3km in a taxi from Seoul Station to Anguk area! We checked into our hanok just outside of Bukchon Hanok Village and strolled down to Insadong. The kaitensushi at Ian Sushi in the Anyoung Insadong mall was good-not-great, and we window shopped and called it a night.

# Days 9-10 - Seoul and home

We were staying in Insadong / Anguk area but I had to pick up my glasses from Davich Optical down in Myeongdong so I jogged across town for a little exercise + errand. Ironically enough our day brought us back to Myeongdong so it was an effort for nothing but maybe highlights how central Myeongdong is.

We got coffee at Fritz Coffee Wonseo, in the Arario Museum front courtyard, which has a lovely seating area in (I think) an old hanok but the coffee was just-ok. We took the metro over to Gyeongbokgung for the day’s highlight, renting hanbok and strolling the palace for photos. The dressup experience was a huge amount of fun for my kids and in the palace we had so many friendly folks approaching us to offer to take photos of us as a family or in some cases, to get pictures WITH us! We rented from “Yes Hanbok” which was something like 30,000krw each so the whole “renting a hanbok is 5,000 won” angle wasn’t quite right.

We were hungry and still needed to do KBBQ in Seoul so we took a taxi down to Myeongdong to go to Daol BBQ specifically. This is a very touristy spot and not the best choice, but the quality of the meat seemed very high, and they did have seafood pancake for my wife although it was just meh. KBBQ in general is so much more expensive than most other foods in Korea, understandably, with the meal for 4 being about 150,000krw.

We did some souvenir shopping, stopping into one of the many Olive Youngs in the area and finding multiple Kpop souvenir stands in the Myeongdong Underground Shopping Center. We made our way back to Insadong for some more ceramic and craft shopping and there was street food stalls with basic food out as well as the many cafes along “Insadong Culture Street” and the malls nearby. Ultimately we got a very excellent dinner at Orena Ramen which was legit Tokyo Station Ramen Street quality and only a short wait, would highly recommend.

Our last day in Seoul we had a few hours to kill before an afternoon flight home and our Airbnb host was very kind to allow us to check out at 1pm. We got coffee and pastries at Hollow Cafe which is fun (and huge!) and strolled the Bukchon Hanok Village, which is crammed with folks angling for photos as well as some sort of film or TV or commercial shoot going on. We grabbed ice cream at Beurre Beurre, hopped in a Venti Kakao taxi back to ICN, and used Priority Pass access to the Asiana lounge to chill before the long flight home.

Lessons learned:

* English was very widely spoken here and only a couple times did we use Google Translate
* Credit cards were used almost everywhere, except some street stalls so it's useful to have 20-50k krw on you
* Taxis in central Seoul were cheap and easy way to get around, outside of rush hours and protests
* Only headache was dealing with the Naver / Google Map / Kakao issue of routefinding and choosing a taxi destination. Naver gives you everything in English, which Kakao T doesn't want, and their search functions are poor.
* People were generally friendly and welcoming to tourists and kids
* Seoul easily held our attention with attractions and activities for 6-7 days
* Buddhist Temple Stay was a trip (and lifetime) highlight experience, highly recommend Great trip report.

Much appreciated ",37,Places to Visit,"Hey fellow Sydneysider!

Here are some foods that I have yet to find in Sydney, or at least a good version of it:

**• Jokbal, specifically 5-spice 오향족발.** It's similar to how Chinese people cook trotters but I've found the ones in Korea superior by far. Haven't found one place in Sydney that has cooked it the way I've had in Korea.  
**• Mulhoe/Mulhwe 물회.** I know there are 2 or 3 places in Sydney that have just started to add it to their menu, including my friend's restaurant Squid Pocha in the city, but it's just not on par with the ones I've had in Korea.  
**• Chinese-Korean food.** The typical Jjajangngmyeon, Jjambbong, etc. There's only one place in Sydney (Lidcombe) that did a decent job of making Chinese-Korean food but it's gone downhill since they stopped hiring Korean cooks and I believe is closed now. The rest I've had have been pretty meh.  
• **Gamja Tang 감자탕.** There used to be a really good restaurant in Strathfield that specialised in it but they have since closed and I have yet to find a new place that does as good of a job, in Korea however it's been good every single time.  
• **Dwaeji Gukbap 돼지국밥.** There are restaurants in Sydney that serve it now, Hansang in Strathfield being one of them, but none of the ones I've had in Sydney have been as good as the ones I've had in Busan. Haven't had it in Seoul, but definitely worth trying imo.  
• **Bean Sprout Soup 콩나물해장국.** I know Yeodongsik in Lidcombe has it on their menu, I have yet to try it but the ones I have had in Korea have been pretty good.

These are just the ones that I can think of from the top of my head.

Oh! And you have to try Salt Bread 소금빵 in Korea. A few bakeries in Sydney have attempted it and it just does not taste the same, not worth the money or time to seek it out. | I hope you are still trying the Korean Fried Chicken because I have not found anything back home that has me the standard set when I was in Korea | 낙곱새 볶 음 | Hotteok Busan Style (the one with seeds)! Delicious!

Samgyeopsal + Hanwoo. Idk but KBBQ hits different in Korea, it tastes better than what I have outside of KR. The meat is so tender and juicy + the charcoal-grilled taste 🤤🤌

Korean toast!!! Buy the ones sold on the streets by old ladies! So filling and delicious. The taste is so perfectly balanced.

UPDATE:

Had a great trip, here are some notes!

\- Currently there are lots of protesters! It's peaceful, don't be alarmed, but the traffic gets way worse on weekends so keep that in mind for scheduling/timing.

\- If you do a hanbok photoshoot, would recommend 1) looking at pics for recommended poses, 2) pick a photographer that speaks your language so they can give you instructions. Mine was very nice but I have no idea how to pose and he couldn't communicate it that well.

\- Jongmyo Shrine: weekdays, must join a tour so time your visit properly (cannot just buy a ticket and walk in) I saw someone who was 10m late and not allowed to just run up and join the tour. weekends: can self-tour (can just buy ticket and walk in)

\- jogyesa temple: beautiful; not fully lit up at night but more peaceful at night than daytime; is a working temple so there were people praying there

\- garosugil: great shopping, the shopkeepers will help teach you how to style their clothes the 'korean' way; keep in mind though they will tell you EVERYTHING looks good even if it doesn't haha

\- do these 2 palaces together: **Changgyeonggung + Changdeokgung + secret garden.** If you sign up for the EARLIEST secret garden tour, it will be the most empty you can get it and thus the most peaceful.

\- Currently, there's not a ton of greenery (still wintery): seoul city wall, naksan park, **Cheonggyecheon Stream**, parks next to han river

\- Namsan cable car: it's not a cable car in the sense of getting a long ride with great scenery in an individual booth-car; it's a lot of people crammed together to reach the bottom of the seoul tower; great view/pics at the top, **not worth it to go to the top of Seoul Tower itself.** food/snacks available

\- honestly we were underwhelmed by every museum we went to (Contemporary History, National Museum of Korea, City Wall museum). all the National museums are free. You need to sign up ahead of time for a timed tour for Empire History, can't just walk in; the museum of mod/contemp art was closed despite being listed as open

\- city hall itself is a cool building to look at and walk through; cafe at the top  


Restaurants I ate at:

Note: finding korean restaurants was more difficult than anticipated. My method as an english speaker: used google maps to search a keyword (sundubu jiggae; bbq; seafood, etc); find what pops up with good google reviews; copy pate the anglicized name into google to find the hangul name; copy paste the hangul name into Kakao maps; check the reviews (there is a papago button under the review that will auto-translate the korean review). I occasionally tried using a hangul keyword (found by typing a keyword into google translate) directly into Kakao maps, but found this overwhelming and not as helpful for narrowing down.

\- ***Myeongdong Kyoja***: in Myeongdong; long line but moves fast; casual; shared tables; got the kalguksu + mandu, delicious and cheap!

\- **tideland house (clam soup bbq)**: 154 heungin-dong Jung-gu Seoul near DDP  and Naksan Park (just east of DDP); great seafood soup that is kept warm on a bbq at the table; my dad was really impressed by the seafood; fresh and unique korean clams

\- **gomtang lab**: in gangnam; great beef soup and clam-beef soup; nice restaurant, is downstairs from a hotel

\- **Silla Jemyeon:** east of bukchon village; one of our favorite restaurants; great clam kalguksu

\-  **Gyoyang siksa**: amazing lamb and customer service

\- fried chicken street on myeongdong isn't amazing; wouldn't bother here; we tried 2. one was BHC and I forget the name of the name of the other one.

\- food at Gangnjang market was fine, nothing to write home about

\- Wangbijib Myeongdong 2nd store: KBBQ; was fine, not too special, lots of foreigners



Apps that I used: 

\- kakao map: better for looking up restaurant reviews

\- naver map: better for directions

FINALLY: HAVE FUN! ",26,Itinerary,"I'm a Korean and somehow ended up on Reddit. First of all, I'm grateful that I'm visiting Seoul. I'll give you some advice even though it's a Korean position. (Please note that foreign tourists and locals are different.)
* I am not good at English, so I write through a translator, so there may be strange sentences. Please let me know if there is a sentence you don't understand.
1. an easy-to-reach museum
It won't take much time to get into any of the museums you mentioned. I personally recommend visiting Natnl Museum of Korea, but the routes do not overlap with the places you mentioned. The Natnl Museum of Korea is centered on ancient Korean artifacts, and the Natnl Museum of Korean Contemp Hx has artifacts that are a little closer to the present. I think the fact that the Natnl Museum of Korean Contemp Hx is near Gwanghwamun (Gwanghwamun is the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace) is a great advantage.
* I'm local but I go to Natnl Museum of Korea sometimes but I don't go to Natnl Museum of Korean Contemp Hx
* You can see the view of Gyeongbokgung Palace from the rooftop of the Ntnl Museum of Korean Contemp Hx
2. Day 1 movement
Tongin Market is on the west side of Gyeongbokgung Palace and Insa-dong is on the east side of Gyeongbokgung Palace. For me, this kind of route is a bit far from walking. (It's about 7,000krw if you take a taxi.) When you walk out the east door of Gyeongbokgung Palace (there is the east door of Gyeongbokgung Palace near the National Folk Museum of Korea), you'll find Buchon Hanok Village and Insa-dong is right next door.
It will be a good experience to buy lunch boxes with Korean traditional coin models at Tongin Market. (Koreans went a lot at first, but not many now. The menu at Tongin Market is not attractive to locals. *It's not that it tastes bad, but it's common to eat at home in Korea.)
* If you go to Tongin Market, I recommend oil tteokbokki. Oil tteokbokki is the only food in Tongin Market. (I like oil tteokbokki, too.)
3. Day2
Why don't you go to Namsan with Myeongdong? It's close. If you take a taxi in front of Lotte Mall, it's about 5000krw. If you take a cable car, you can walk. (I don't recommend the bus. I have to transfer. *Seoul has no or very few transfer fees. You can transfer 200-300krw subway-bus, too.)
Olive Young is in so many places in Korea. If there are too many people in Myeongdong Olive Young, it's good to visit other places.
4. Day3
How about Cheonggyecheon-DDP-Naksan Park? (walk) And the night view of Naksan Park is fantastic. However, it may be hard to get a taxi when you go down from Naksan Park.
* In Korea, you can call a taxi with the K-ride app. But Naksan Park doesn't prefer drivers to come up because it's up in the mountains.
* There is Hyehwa-dong under Naksan Park, where you can enjoy various performances.
5. Day4
Seoul Forest-Seongsu-CoX Mall-Garosu-gil Route Recommendation
Check the difference between Bongeun Temple and Jogye Temple near COEX Mall. (Slightly different features.)
If you enjoy the Han River and see the Han River Fountain, I recommend Banpo Han River Park. (Even Koreans love the Banpo Han River Fountain at night.)
6. Salt bread
Actually, the prototype of salt bread is Japan. But I recommend salt bread!
* I recommend ""onion"" bakery when you go to Bukchon Hanok Village. Salt bread is not famous, but you can enjoy bread and coffee at the hanok. (You may have to wait to enter.)
7. Hotel recommendation
Personally, I think ""Lotte Hotel Seoul"" is the best location.
There are so many hotels around here, so you can look it up and make a reservation. 
Hotels in Korea are very safe. All the hotels you can book on the website are safe places. 
8. a hair salon
I recommend JUNO HAIR. It's a hair salon chain. It won't be bad. It's recommended to make a reservation through the hotel concierge
I hope you have a great time in Korea. | Looks goods. I am going around the same time and have similar places I am going to,m. First time as well.

I pre booked some items from Klook. Also think about eSIM. | Sounds perfect! I bought lot of fashion items when I visited myeondong!
Myeong dong kyoja was wonderful restaurant and bought fancy glasses in Gana Optical myeongdong!
They made my glasses in 20 min. Beautiful!
Enjoy lovely trip! | Just following.   We are going end of November so this is immensely helpful! | Fantastic! 

I look forward to applying your excellent itinerary at the beginning of April. 

Thanks!","Itinerary Hi! Wondering if someone could take a look at my itinerary? This will be my first time going. The plan is to stay in Insadong or Myeongdong area. This is cobbled together based on several different travel blogs + reddit posts. Will be going in March/April!

Seoul Forest-Seongsu-CoX Mall-Garosu-gil Route Recommendation
Check the difference between Bongeun Temple and Jogye Temple near COEX Mall. (Slightly different features.)
If you enjoy the Han River and see the Han River Fountain, I recommend Banpo Han River Park. (Even Koreans love the Banpo Han River Fountain at night.)
6. Salt bread
Actually, the prototype of salt bread is Japan. But I recommend salt bread!
* I recommend ""onion"" bakery when you go to Bukchon Hanok Village. Salt bread is not famous, but you can enjoy bread and coffee at the hanok. (You may have to wait to enter.)
7. Hotel recommendation
Personally, I think ""Lotte Hotel Seoul"" is the best location.
There are so many hotels around here, so you can look it up and make a reservation. 
Hotels in Korea are very safe. All the hotels you can book on the website are safe places. 
8. a hair salon
I recommend JUNO HAIR. It's a hair salon chain. It won't be bad. It's recommended to make a reservation through the hotel concierge
I hope you have a great time in Korea. | Looks goods. I am going around the same time and have similar places I am going to,m. First time as well.

I pre booked some items from Klook. Also think about eSIM. | Sounds perfect! I bought lot of fashion items when I visited myeondong!
Myeong dong kyoja was wonderful restaurant and bought fancy glasses in Gana Optical myeongdong!
They made my glasses in 20 min. Beautiful!
Enjoy lovely trip! | Just following.   We are going end of November so this is immensely helpful! | Fantastic! 

I look forward to applying your excellent itinerary at the beginning of April. 

Thanks!"

Like it was said previously, a lot of clubs in Hongdae will not let you in if you are 30+ and also alone. You can find some cool bars that do not care much about the age.  It would be better to stay near by Itaewon if you want to go out at night where the crowd is more diverse, in age and also nationality/ethnicity wise because it's a foreigner area so you will not get any issue getting inside a club. It's also quite close by Myeongdong and not far from Gangnam, Hongdae, Sinchon area. I used to live in SK and when I  was living there it was by far the most convenient area to get around town by subway, bus and taxi.  
  
The water show is not running during winter time in Banpo from what I remember. Keep in mind that you will there in January and it is quite cold at that time so all activities near by the river/water might be difficult because of the cold and/or because some activities might not be available. 

There is a lot a walking in your schedule so you should try to maybe rethink your schedule for Tuesday and Wednesday. Personally, I liked being on top of the Lotte tower more than the 63 building and it's higher !

Also to be safe, I would come back to Seoul, the night before not the same day ..

Take some warm clothes as it could be a bit difficult to find clothes for men if you are on the chubby side (you do have h&m, zara, uniqlo though) 

Enjoy your trip ! | Friday Jan 10 I’d say go to the temple. I’ve been to Taejongdae park and it was OK. I’d recommend cheongsapo or Igidae skywalk over it. Igidae is a bit out of the way. But CheongSapo is sorta near Haeundae beach.

But also, even the “solo portions” are big so just don’t feel bad if you can’t finish smt. went to a stall in mangwon market and the sigle portion was 5 hand sized fried dumplings 😭 

also, dont be afraid to ask at restaurants. sometimes they let you in if you are solo and order more than one portion but remember that you probably won’t be able to finish it 🥲

You might want to check out this yt channel called 또간집, it’s this girl who tries places around korea solo, but to be fair she can eat a lot. | There are many dishes that are originally served as single portions (for example, bibimbap, naengmyeon, kimchi stew, gimbap, etc.), but most of the dishes you're interested in usually need to be ordered for two or more people. This can vary depending on the restaurant, but that's my opinion 😂. However, if you are an adult male, you might be able to finish a portion for two people by yourself.

I'm not sure what ""Namyeong noodles"" are. It doesn't seem to be a widely known term, and it might be referring to a specific restaurant. If you tell me the restaurant, I can look it up for you 😊. | If I remember right, there were some places that had price per person portions. With army stew you may have a hard time getting an individual portion. In general, korean restaurants serve a larger portion so you may need to understand that some food will be wasted. Naengmyeon (i think you meant this) will be an individual portion. I watch a lot of Strictly dumpling and seonkyong longest for korean food ideas and trip ideas!

(Excuse my lack of Korean/spelling)

Pigs feet
Jjim dak (soy sauce chicken and noodles)
Army stew
Cow intestines 
The seafood in the common aquarium market
The meat market where they have hanwoo beef
And last, is namyeong noodles served during the winter?

I may have more to add. But im aware of the street food, delivery apps, and convenient stores. I'm sure I can live not eating what I mentioned but I love it all too much. Maybe I will end up buying family portions. Who knows? TIA  There are plenty of solo dining meat places, just look for 혼밥 on Naver maps and there should be plenty of pics to guide you. If you dm me your general visiting areas, I can help locate restaurants for you.

Some links to help :)

https://naver.me/GL8YIYjf | yeah it’s hard and I personally ended up just going to a convenience store more than a few times. If you can, try to find some people to dine with. made my trip sm better because many places give soo much food. But also, even the “solo portions” are big so just don’t feel bad if you can’t finish smt. went to a stall in mangwon market and the sigle portion was 5 hand sized fried dumplings 😭 

also, dont be afraid to ask at restaurants. sometimes they let you in if you are solo and order more than one portion but remember that you probably won’t be able to finish it 🥲

You might want to check out this yt channel called 또간집, it’s this girl who tries places around korea solo, but to be fair she can eat a lot. | There are many dishes that are originally served as single portions (for example, bibimbap, naengmyeon, kimchi stew, gimbap, etc.), but most of the dishes you're interested in usually need to be ordered for two or more people. This can vary depending on the restaurant, but that's my opinion 😂. However, if you are an adult male, you might be able to finish a portion for two people by yourself.

I'm not sure what ""Namyeong noodles"" are. It doesn't seem to be a widely known term, and it might be referring to a specific restaurant. If you tell me the restaurant, I can look it up for you 😊. | If I remember right, there were some places that had price per person portions. With army stew you may have a hard time getting an individual portion. In general, korean restaurants serve a larger portion so you may need to understand that some food will be wasted. Naengmyeon (i think you meant this) will be an individual portion. I watch a lot of Strictly dumpling and seonkyong longest for korean food ideas and trip ideas! Make sure you reserve time to go to the food stalls and get some tteokbokki with odeng (fish cakes with soup), soon dae, and hotteok! | Where are you going? What city and neighborhood?

1k3gm28,Daegu and Seoul July 2024,15,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3gm28,1745131594.0,"Went to Daegu and Seoul last summer. 

1. National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art - Really cool museum across the street from Gyeongbukgong. In addition to this neon piece they had an interactive playground with a basketball hoop, interesting short films, and a nice gift shop. Has lockers.
2 and 3. Cocktails from Zoo Sindang. Neat bar where you climb through a tiny door to get in. Put your name on the list in advance, if possible. Even on a Monday I had to wait around fifteen minutes before a spot at the bar opened up. The interior is gorgeous. I heard the bathroom was cool, too. Drinks are pricey, but still a good experience.
4. Cute dog in a shop in Dongseongro in Daegu. Dongseongro is in Downtown Daegu where there a bunch of bars, shops, and clubs. It can feel maze like, but I like that it feels never ending.
5. Barbarella in Downtown Daegu, not far from the Jungangno subway stop. There was a heavy, heavy downpour keeping people from going outside that night. It felt like having the bar to myself. The interior is neon-lit and covered in drawings. The music is very, very hip. Think 70s and 80s punk rock. It reminded me of Organ. I don’t know if Organ is still in Daegu, but it had a similar vibe. It was a downstairs bar lit in blue that played Human League and The Smiths.
6. When I lived in Daegu a very long time ago it used to be called Colorful Daegu. I was surprised to see it had changed to Powerful Daegu. There used to be a Colorful Daegu parade. I can only assume they changed that too.
7. Dog hanging out at a CU in Waegwan. It really wanted my kimbap. Waegwan is a small town along the Nakdong River about twenty minutes away by train on the Mugunghwa. It’s a military town and hosts Camp Walker.
8 and 9. A baseball game at Samsung Lions Park. The Samsung Lions absolutely obliterated the NC Dinos that night. Baseball games are really fun. They put the lyrics to each player’s theme song on the screens so you could sing along. Samsung Lions Park has its own stop on the Green Line and is also easily accessible by bus. Tickets are cheap. I don’t think I paid more than 20,000 won for two people for outfield seats. It was easy to buy tickets there, no need to buy in advance.

Visiting during the rainy season in the summer can definitely make things difficult. Train lines around Daegu were disrupted due to the rain, so I actually took a taxi to Waegwan instead of my original plan on the Mugunghwa. Some shops also closed early in Downtown Daegu because of the rain. I ended up finding refuge at a chicken and beer place to wait it out.

1fu8oa9,5d4n itinerary critique and food suggestions,12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fu8oa9,1727845878.0,"Hi yall, I'm going to a trip to Seoul in Oct/Nov and came up with this rough itinerary.

This is my first time  to Korea and most of this is based off of research from koreatodo.com and r/travel korea. To me I'm not sure if this is the most time efficient way to do things or if I've packed in way too many tourist spots. 

Do you reckon this is feasible? Way too packed? Or too time inefficient? Would appreciate if yall can give me some critique and suggestions.

One of my main concerns is where to slot the N tower visit, I think the day I have it one is kinda tight and am wondering if I should just visit it the first night.

I'm also looking to get some food recommendations, I'm not really into lining up for food so if yall have any favourite wall in the hole restaurants I would love to hear about them. I'm super into bokssam and jokbbal but will also be more than happy to try new foods!

Thank you in advance!


",23,Suggestions,"There is this place called Myeongdong Kyoja in Myeongdong. One of my favs.
Edit: menu is kalguksu and dumpling | Hihi! For Thursday, I recommend going to London Bagel Museum for lunch instead as Cafe Layered only has scones and cake I think (unless you’re going there for dessert)! Also, google “London bagel museum catch table” to get a queue number before you reach there. Dining in usually has a really long wait! 
For dinner, I recommend Backdon! It’s kbbq and they have the besssssst steamed eggs!! 

You also have to try Sulbing (shaved ice) and Bbq chicken (best fried chicken in Korea imo) - both has many outlets everywhere. 
I recommend the bbq chicken outlet in euljiro instead of myeongdong (myeongdong one is slightly more expensive + fewer options) 

For Hongdae, there are soooo many delicious options at Yeonnam! I’ve heard Grain is good but have yet to try it:) there’s also Mangwon Market nearby where you can grab food ! But the market only fully opens around 10-11am. 

Sorry I didn’t really look at your activities because I’m more interested in food 🤓! | So, for good Chinese Korean food, I'd recommend Hawon in Insadong. Jajjangmyun, jjambbong and kkangpoongi were all excellent. Very affordable.

I would also skip Dongdaemun entirely. It's just by far low down in the spots of Seoul I'd recommend to anyone.

Definitely set aside extra time for Bukchon/Samcheong-dong and Insadong. There is a lot to wander around and looks at/shopping. In Bukchon there is also a really nice and fancy Chinese restaurant called Mongjoongheon (몽중헌) that I recommend. It is fancier and more expensive though. 

I do recommend Namsan tower as a classic Seoul experience and chance to get a good view of the city.

For clothes shopping I recommend Hongdae, Gangnam subway market and Jongak subway market. If you do find yourself in Gangnam, try going to the Sigol Yachae Dwenjang restaurant and order the Dwenjang bibimbap. You won't regret it! They are famous and timeless. 

If you really want to go to a traditional market you might try Noryangjin or Tongin. You can also try out a pojangmacha street like near Jongro3ga at night for a more traditional/old fashioned experience. Lots of street food around Anguk station near Insadong. 

Last piece of advice: use Naver and Naver Maps for everything. If you can search in Korean you get better results. If you want guaranteed solid food, pick something with at least a 4.3 on Naver and if you want positively excellent food, find one that is over 4.5. | I’d recommend giving more time to the Secret Garden + palace grounds. We found Gyeongbokgung to be rather underwhelming. I think even the hanbok photos would look a lot better in the secret garden area. If you time it well, you can join the free tour after buying your tickets for the secret garden at the palace entrance at 10.30 am. | For dinner in Myeongdong I recommend Myeongdong Gyoja, as someone else has already mentioned. Going from Insadong there’s great restaurants [around this alley](https://naver.me/Gmb3CYHB) (I linked a popular tea house for reference of the area, not to suggest dinner there lol). Sujebi restaurants for example. Or if you would like some K-BBQ it’s a whole vibe that locals love as well [on this street](https://naver.me/5pw2TyEe) and the main street next to it (Jongno3ga).

We have most of our schedule planned out, and although I'm the type of person who doesn’t worry too much about restaurants and just eats whatever is nearby when I get hungry, I’d still like to have some references for the areas we’ll be visiting because there are certain foods I don’t want to miss.

On social media, I only find super trendy places, and I’d rather avoid long lines. I’m not looking for anything too fancy, nor does it have to be local favorites, but if you have any recommendations for the following locations, I’d really appreciate it:

* KBBQ spots in Yongsan
* Korean-Chinese food in Jongno
* A traditional tea house near Insadong
* Fried chicken near Mapo

For tteokbokki and other popular dishes, would Gwangjang Market be a good choice? I’m trying to avoid it, but if there isn’t a better option, I’d go.

I’m probably missing a few things—would you recommend anything else?

Thank you so much!

I thought they may be interesting/useful to some people here, so please read if you are interested.

A few notes on context before I start: The intended audience for these logs was my parents and in-laws, who know nothing about Korea. I'm sure some of this will seem obvious/dumb to more knowledgeable readers, so please keep that in mind.  We also went into this trip with relatively few preconceptions about Korea; we chose to come because my job was flying me out for a conference, not because of a pre-existing interest in the culture, so there was lots we did not know. Overall, we've had a great time and I hope this is useful to someone. Let me know if you have any questions!

Note: I've replaced my partner's name with P and my name with E.



DAY 1

We spent our first day in Seoul visiting cultural sites in historic northern part of the city, far from the bright lights of the city center. We started the day by looking for a place to eat breakfast. While there are many cute looking coffee shops, we learned that few are open before 10am. Eventually we found a very nice pastry place however. We then then walked to Changdeokgung Palace, a historical royal residence, and spent the morning exploring the gardens there. The buildings are very ornate, and the gardens are  beautiful and serene. Next, we did some shopping at a local market filled with tiny winding alleyways and got some lunch at a surprisingly authentic French restaurant.

We then walked over to the modern art museum, and saw lots of weird and off-kilter exhibits that we quite enjoyed. Our last stop was gyeongdeokgung palace, another large royal residence. We saw lots of people wearing rented traditional Korean folk outfits, which was neat. By this time, we were exhausted so we went home for a nap. When we were ready for dinner, we went to a cafe around the corner. The only food items in the menu were curry lasagna, pepperoni pizza, and nachos. Too tired to go elsewhere, we ordered the pizza, and then found an ice cream place near by. Now we are back home and ready for bed. Tomorrow we are going for a guided hike, which should be fun. Talk to you soon!



DAY 2

Today was the day of our big hike. Our guide, a veteran local hiker and rock climber named B, picked us up at 7:30am and drove us to Bukhansan national park, just outside of the city. He told us the hike we were doing was ‘moderate’ difficulty, but we could see the mountain looming as we drove up and they looked  anything but. When we arrived, we took a few minutes to visit a local Buddhist shire as he parked the car, and then we were off.

The first stretch of the hike was a steep climb through a thick forest, up until the trees started to give way to more barren rocks. The climb got progressively steeper, until near the top, with our thighs near the breaking point, the trail became an unbroken steep rocky face with steel guide wires driven into the rock to help you up. We barely made it up to the summit, where we had time to snap some pics before eating lunch on an overlook there. The peak (the highest in the Seoul region) afforded breathtaking panoramic views of Seoul, and we also saw a very cute family of wild dogs with puppies that seemed to live by begging hikers for food. B gave us a lunch of Kimbap, a sort of oversized rice roll with kimchi and other fillings, but neither of us could have more than a few bites.

The way down was also very steep, and by the time we made it home, my step tracker said we had climbed 160(!!) flights. We bought some ice cream, took a shower and a nap before waking up for dinner. We had a hard time finding a place that was still open and serving dinner oddly, but eventually we settled on a chicken and beer place, apparently a real local staple. Now we are home, and getting ready for bed. Tomorrow we are flying to Jeju island, and looking forward to spending some time by the pool.



DAY 3

Today was the day of our flight to Jeju island, so a lot of schlepping to and from the airport. We woke up early and went looking for breakfast near our Airbnb in Seoul. The only cafe open at 7am was a place called ‘Onion;’ an improbable name for a place selling mostly upscale sugary pastries and coffee. The pastries were quite good however, and the setting was unique.

We took the metro to Gimpo airport, the smaller airport mostly for domestic travel. The Seoul metro is very clean, and very quiet. No one talks, no one looks around, no one looks anyone in the eye; it honesty feels more like a library than the T or the MTA.

Our flight to Jeju was short but a bit bumpy, and our hotel was in the other side of the island, so we had a long bus ride ahead of us. The island is dotted with palm trees, lush forest, and hills that surround the (hopefully) dormant volcanic peak at the center.

After we got checked in, we went out in search of dinner, but again had a hard time finding good options. P wanted a nice salad, but that seems not to be a popular menu item here. It’s mostly seafood and bbq pork. We finally found a place that served some caprese and settled for that.

Afterwards we went for a walk through a local street market, a dense tangle of fruit stands, fish sellers, and gift shops. The island is known for its citrus, so we bought some tangerines, and ate them at the rooftop lounge at our hotel, before jumping in the pool. We had great views of the harbor and outlying islands, as well as a rainbow-powered sunset. Now we are back in our hotel room, showering off and getting ready for bed. Tomorrow we will explore the area a bit more, and maybe lounge by the pool.



DAY 4

We woke up early this morning and got breakfast at the hotel, which was great because it was varied and all-you-can eat. They even had some leafy greens for P, so it worked out really well, given how light our dinner was yesterday.

We spent the morning on an extended nature walk. The town we are staying in, called Seogwipo, is known for its coastal features and waterfalls, so we walked first to Cheonjiyeong falls, about 45 minutes walk from our hotel. The falls are very pretty, and the park surrounding them was full of these funky basalt statues that are something of a mascot for the island. It was a hot day, so picked up some slushies afterwards before walking 30 minutes to our next stop, a series of beautiful tidal pools and rock formations. They really were quite pretty, so we spent a while observing and taking pictures before heading back. We stopped at an aggressively cute and instagramable cafe on our way home for a big lunch, and made it back with plenty of time to hit the pool.

We spent a couple hours poolside and planning our day for tomorrow, before deciding to get some food. We had such a big breakfast and lunch that we weren’t really that hungry for dinner, so we walked around seogwipo to find ice cream. The town is an interesting place, it doesn’t really have the charm you might expect of a seaside vacation destination, but it is still nice to walk around.

We came home and watched some TV, and now we are getting ready for bed. Tomorrow I think we will explore more distant parts of the island.



DAY 5

We started off the day with another breakfast buffet at our hotel, before walking across town to another beautiful waterfall, this one called jeongbang. It was very unique because it falls almost directly into the ocean, and because they let you get quite close, so we got some good pics.

Next we got a taxi about an hour up the coast to an area called Yeongmori that is supposed to have great views and unique geological formations, however when we got there it was closed due to weather. We weren’t quite sure why, because it was a nice day. Near by was mount sanbangsan, a huge jagged mountain near the coast that also hosts an ancient Buddhist shrine and grotto. We decided to walk up the mountain toward the grotto, which was a good short hike uphill with tons of stairs that we have come to expect, but were rewarded with a beautiful spiritual cave filled with religious icons.

We could see from the top of the hill that they had started letting people on to the Yeongmori coast trail! So we hurried back down, and were treated to a really special cliff walk, right along the surf, and got to see all these flat layered rocks that form the cliffs.

We stopped for a late lunch (more sweet drinks and pastries; apparently that is all cafes have here), before heading back to our hotel for more time poolside, which was so relaxing.

We decided to go out for Korean BBQ for dinner, which is obviously a favorite here, especially on Jeju, which is known for it. KBBQ is a fun and interactive way to eat a meal. There is a charcoal grill built into your table, and they give you a bunch of veggie sides and lettuce leaves, as well as a chunk of uncooked meat. You cut the meat into little bits with scissors, and roast them yourself over the grill, then you take a leaf in you palm, add a piece of meat, and whatever sauces and sides you want, curl it all into a kind of lettuce taco, and stuff as much into your mouth at once as you can. Meanwhile, you need to keep your eyes on the grill so you don’t burn anything. Overall, we really enjoyed it despite the chaos of it, and it was our favorite meal so far!

We went out for more ice cream after, and finished it on the roof of our hotel. Now we’re are unwinding and getting ready for tomorrow, when we fly back to Seoul for a few days.



DAY 6

We were mostly traveling today, so not as much to report as usual. We awoke early in Jeju to a lot of rain. Apparently it is the rainy season there, so we lucked out with two days of good weather. We got breakfast at the hotel again, and then a bus, a plane, a train and 6 hours later, we were at our hotel in Seoul.

Our current hotel is in a neighborhood called Hongdae, known for its proximity to the universities, and for being a night life area. We walked around some in the area, and found it to be quite neigborhoody actually, in a pleasant way.

We went to a local Thai restaurant and had a really good meal, one of the best of the trip so far.

We walked around some more before hanging out on our hotel rooftop for a bit, and now we are relaxing in the room.

Tomorrow we have some unscheduled time, so we might explore the bright lights of downtown, before we have a cooking class in the afternoon.



DAY 7 (my partner wrote this one, the style is a bit different)

Today’s theme was ~frivolous~

We started our day with a challenge to find breakfast and ended up at a yummy and hip egg sandwich spot. Only Seoul could make egg sandwiches sweet.

We then put E’s public transportation navigation skills to the test and took the train and then a mini bus to Namsang Garden which is a large park in the Itaewon neighborhood. We saw a funky looking bird which resembled a quail, and a beautiful lotus pond.

Next we went to a cafe called Berry Berry Very Much which took the classic Korean “make it cute” to new levels. We split a slice of strawberry creme cake and berry iced tea and it was heavenly.

Did we then take an hour train ride and 30 min sweaty bus ride to Gangnam just to see the Gangnam Style statue? Yes, yes we did. E refused to do the dance in the picture with me but I still want to marry him anyway.

We walked around the famed massive Coex Mall until we got overstimulated and made our way to our cooking class!

The class started with a walk through the market and we tried various foods along the way including kimbap and spiral doughnuts. Next we went back to the chefs house and made 4 different meals. Everything was delicious!

Next we went for a walk along the river front, before heading back to our hotel for the pool. The water was actually kinda cold, so we didn’t stay long and now are getting ready for bed. Tomorrow is our last full day, and we need to wake up early to meet our DMZ tour bus.



DAY 8

Our last day together in Korea! P flies home bright and early tomorrow, but I’m sticking around for several days for a conference.

We did our DMZ tour today, which was definitely a strange, at times jarring experience. We woke up early to meet our tour bus, which drove us to a memorial park area near the border where there are many monuments and large sculptures dedicated to the war. This is juxtaposed against rather a lot of kitsch, including a small amusement park, a Dunkin’ donuts, and a Boston Burger Company Location, of all things.

Our next stop was a tunnel that had been dug by the North Koreans in an attempt to infiltrate the south. It is a cramped and dank place, deep underground, too short to stand up straight. There isn’t all that much to see down there, but there is still a gift shop!

Next they took us to the observatory, where they have telescopes that could see into the north. Unfortunately it was rainy and overcast, so we couldn’t really see much. Our last stop was a village near the border, where they sell local produce and more souvenirs.

Overall, parts of the experience were thought provoking, and the guide had lots of info, but it was just really odd. Photography was not allowed in many places, so we don’t have many pics to share from the tour.

When we got back to our hotel in the afternoon, it was time for a nap, and then off to dinner. We decided to do Korean bbq again, as a last day treat. Still delicious and fun! Afterwards, we went for a walk around town, which was bustling with college kids out for Saturday night. We decided to stop at a self-service Photo Booth Shop to take some cute pictures which seems to be very popular here; there are many such stores, and they are all busy. We also stopped at an arcade to see if we could win a stuffed animal, but no luck!

Finally, we got some fancy ice cream (of course!) before walking back to the hotel.

Now we are packing up, happy at our fun trip, but sad to be parting ways in the morning. I don’t think I will be writing reports for the next few days, as I will just be at the conference, but I’m sure I will be in touch nonetheless.

We spent a couple hours poolside and planning our day for tomorrow, before deciding to get some food. We had such a big breakfast and lunch that we weren’t really that hungry for dinner, so we walked around seogwipo to find ice cream. The town is an interesting place, it doesn’t really have the charm you might expect of a seaside vacation destination, but it is still nice to walk around.

We came home and watched some TV, and now we are getting ready for bed. Tomorrow I think we will explore more distant parts of the island.



DAY 5

We started off the day with another breakfast buffet at our hotel, before walking across town to another beautiful waterfall, this one called jeongbang. It was very unique because it falls almost directly into the ocean, and because they let you get quite close, so we got some good pics.

Next we got a taxi about an hour up the coast to an area called Yeongmori that is supposed to have great views and unique geological formations, however when we got there it was closed due to weather. We weren’t quite sure why, because it was a nice day. Near by was mount sanbangsan, a huge jagged mountain near the coast that also hosts an ancient Buddhist shrine and grotto. We decided to walk up the mountain toward the grotto, which was a good short hike uphill with tons of stairs that we have come to expect, but were rewarded with a beautiful spiritual cave filled with religious icons.

We could see from the top of the hill that they had started letting people on to the Yeongmori coast trail! So we hurried back down, and were treated to a really special cliff walk, right along the surf, and got to see all these flat layered rocks that form the cliffs.

We stopped for a late lunch (more sweet drinks and pastries; apparently that is all cafes have here), before heading back to our hotel for more time poolside, which was so relaxing.

We decided to go out for Korean BBQ for dinner, which is obviously a favorite here, especially on Jeju, which is known for it. KBBQ is a fun and interactive way to eat a meal. There is a charcoal grill built into your table, and they give you a bunch of veggie sides and lettuce leaves, as well as a chunk of uncooked meat. You cut the meat into little bits with scissors, and roast them yourself over the grill, then you take a leaf in you palm, add a piece of meat, and whatever sauces and sides you want, curl it all into a kind of lettuce taco, and stuff as much into your mouth at once as you can. Meanwhile, you need to keep your eyes on the grill so you don’t burn anything. Overall, we really enjoyed it despite the chaos of it, and it was our favorite meal so far!

We went out for more ice cream after, and finished it on the roof of our hotel. Now we’re are unwinding and getting ready for tomorrow, when we fly back to Seoul for a few days.



DAY 6

We were mostly traveling today, so not as much to report as usual. We awoke early in Jeju to a lot of rain. Apparently it is the rainy season there, so we lucked out with two days of good weather. We got breakfast at the hotel again, and then a bus, a plane, a train and 6 hours later, we were at our hotel in Seoul.

Our current hotel is in a neighborhood called Hongdae, known for its proximity to the universities, and for being a night life area. We walked around some in the area, and found it to be quite neigborhoody actually, in a pleasant way.

We went to a local Thai restaurant and had a really good meal, one of the best of the trip so far.

We walked around some more before hanging out on our hotel rooftop for a bit, and now we are relaxing in the room.

Tomorrow we have some unscheduled time, so we might explore the bright lights of downtown, before we have a cooking class in the afternoon.



DAY 7 (my partner wrote this one, the style is a bit different)

Today’s theme was ~frivolous~

We started our day with a challenge to find breakfast and ended up at a yummy and hip egg sandwich spot. Only Seoul could make egg sandwiches sweet.

We then put E’s public transportation navigation skills to the test and took the train and then a mini bus to Namsang Garden which is a large park in the Itaewon neighborhood. We saw a funky looking bird which resembled a quail, and a beautiful lotus pond.

Next we went to a cafe called Berry Berry Very Much which took the classic Korean “make it cute” to new levels. We split a slice of strawberry creme cake and berry iced tea and it was heavenly.

Did we then take an hour train ride and 30 min sweaty bus ride to Gangnam just to see the Gangnam Style statue? Yes, yes we did. E refused to do the dance in the picture with me but I still want to marry him anyway.

We walked around the famed massive Coex Mall until we got overstimulated and made our way to our cooking class!

The class started with a walk through the market and we tried various foods along the way including kimbap and spiral doughnuts. Next we went back to the chefs house and made 4 different meals. Everything was delicious!

Next we went for a walk along the river front, before heading back to our hotel for the pool. The water was actually kinda cold, so we didn’t stay long and now are getting ready for bed. Tomorrow is our last full day, and we need to wake up early to meet our DMZ tour bus.



DAY 8

Our last day together in Korea! P flies home bright and early tomorrow, but I’m sticking around for several days for a conference.

We did our DMZ tour today, which was definitely a strange, at times jarring experience. We woke up early to meet our tour bus, which drove us to a memorial park area near the border where there are many monuments and large sculptures dedicated to the war. This is juxtaposed against rather a lot of kitsch, including a small amusement park, a Dunkin’ donuts, and a Boston Burger Company Location, of all things.

Our next stop was a tunnel that had been dug by the North Koreans in an attempt to infiltrate the south. It is a cramped and dank place, deep underground, too short to stand up straight. There isn’t all that much to see down there, but there is still a gift shop!

Next they took us to the observatory, where they have telescopes that could see into the north. Unfortunately it was rainy and overcast, so we couldn’t really see much. Our last stop was a village near the border, where they sell local produce and more souvenirs.

Overall, parts of the experience were thought provoking, and the guide had lots of info, but it was just really odd. Photography was not allowed in many places, so we don’t have many pics to share from the tour.

When we got back to our hotel in the afternoon, it was time for a nap, and then off to dinner. We decided to do Korean bbq again, as a last day treat. Still delicious and fun! Afterwards, we went for a walk around town, which was bustling with college kids out for Saturday night. We decided to stop at a self-service Photo Booth Shop to take some cute pictures which seems to be very popular here; there are many such stores, and they are all busy. We also stopped at an arcade to see if we could win a stuffed animal, but no luck!

Finally, we got some fancy ice cream (of course!) before walking back to the hotel.

Now we are packing up, happy at our fun trip, but sad to be parting ways in the morning. I don’t think I will be writing reports for the next few days, as I will just be at the conference, but I’m sure I will be in touch nonetheless.

1fxz311,3 days in Incheon with young kids,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1fxz311/3_days_in_incheon_with_young_kids/,1728273773.0,"Sharing some experiences from my recent trip in October! This will be a bit long, but I hope it will encourage more to visit Incheon area... In fact, I enjoyed it more than our Seoul leg because the city was calmer and more peaceful.

>>>

ACCOMMODATION
We stayed at a lovely apartment a few mins away from Incheon Station Line 1 and we also enjoyed an amazing view of the roads/tracks! My kids would just sit at the window to watch :)

WEATHER
I was surprised by the sudden drop in temperature to the 10s, but thankfully we had pullovers and hoodies to stay warm.

MAPS
Naver worked perfectly fine for us. I recommend pinning all your locations beforehand so you can click the 'From' and 'To' buttons to find your routes easily... 

SUBWAY
We got our t-money cards from the CU convenience store at the airport, and ensured they were topped up. Kids aged 6 and below travel free! Just ensure that they go through the gantries together with you to avoid the gantry doors closing on them... 

GETTING AROUND WITH A STROLLER
This was a bit challenging at some stations because some platforms and exits did not have lift access. Be prepared to carry your stroller up and down stairs if you can't locate the nearby lift. Or take longer detours to your destination because of lifts are only at certain exits. 

We relied on signage and in-station maps to locate exactly where the subway lift was, because Naver didn't always indicate where they were.

DINING WITH KIDS
My preschoolers don't use high chairs anymore but I did see them available. The staff will usually bring out a small plate and fork for the kids to use. Freeflow water was almost always available.

TOILETS
Subway ones were clean and my kids used them with no issues. Be prepared for some public toilets to not have soap! (We brought paper soap around so this helped)

INTERACTIONS WITH LOCALS
People were very kind and helpful when they saw our kids. The elderly love interacting with them, despite the language barrier. Do prep your kids if they are not used to strangers touching or talking to them!

TRIP HIGHLIGHTS
• Incheon Chinatown: Very steep climb up... We ate at Taehwa, it was yummy but the jjamppong gave me an upset stomach. The kids ate fried rice and that was ok!

• Jajangmyeon Museum: Very tiny place but it was fun for the kids to look around. It was free entry when we went on a public holiday.

• Sangsang Platform: No exhibitions there when we went, but just a big wide place for the kids to run around!

• Incheon Art Platform: Very peaceful and nice to take photos! I wish I had more time to explore...

• Monster Park Guwol: My kids loved this indoor playground! We went at opening time on a weekday morning and we had the entire place to ourselves. It was big, new and very clean! Located inside the Homeplus supermarket.

• Sinpo International Market: We were a bit too early around 9am so many of the stalls weren't open yet. But there were locals queuing for fried chicken at 10am!

• Wolmido: You can pay for each theme park ride and there are quite a lot of kiddy options! It's all very old school but it adds to the atmosphere. We were there on a public holiday week night and it was bustling! Loved walking by the seaside and along the shops too...

인천 중구 월미문화로 27: Some of the best meals we ever had! The ahjummas will teach you how to grill the seafood and it was all very fresh! My kids sat down for 2h enjoying the food and that says a lot heh.

• Triple Street Mall: So so many shops and F&B options... Head to the grass roof for a nice view! We didn't go to the Zoo cafe in the end because it looked a bit underwhelming and dirty from the outside but I could be wrong...

• Convenience stores: Gimbap, yoghurt and milk for breakfast! Instant noodles for supper... We all enjoyed our meals from here.

* Walk around if got spare time if not .....
* Rest

Day 3: Palace Day

Feel free to ask more questions!

1. Udo day was so worth it! We rented e-bikes on the day of the trip as soon as we got to the port. Vendor spoke English and it was 10,000 won per day to rent bike for the entire day until 5pm. So fun and it took about 2-3 hours with many breaks and a meal. Don’t forget to bring your passport to buy a ferry ticket! You will need at least one person in your party with a passport to buy tickets 
2. If you have T-mobile with Magenta Plus or above plan, you can get by without buying a eSIM. There were some spots where service would drop but for the most part, it was fine and not worth buying another plan. Free WiFi was readily available 
3. Delivery food app worked with our visa credit card through 배달의민족!! You do need to know the language a bit to use it but nevertheless, we were able to order fried chicken to our Airbnb. Score!
4. We had a rental EV in Jeju with Lotte. Like some others mentioned, we did run into a couple charging stations that would not accept the Lotte membership card but we did find one eventually that works. Be aware that there are many charging stations but only one station per location.
5. Uber works fine in Busan. Works just like US but app will not ask for tips at the end of the trip!
6. Unlike Seoul, Busan/Jeju doesn’t have as many English speakers. Many in the touristy areas tried to speak Chinese to us because they have so many Chinese tourists coming through.

Day 2: rest.........

I can't imagine anyone less than 65 would want to rest on the first full day of being in a new country. | A lot of the days with specific times at specific places seem to be potentially tiring. I would suggest to avoid being too time-specific.

  
Hongdae comes alive a night only so I don't know if you will get to really experience that if you go there in the afternoon. But then I see you are spending like 2 hours at a cafe after dinner so I'm not sure if you'd be open to spending that time in Hongdae instead. | Have some breathing room. This level of scheduling seems tiring, no? | Day 6 has many interesting spots. I'd divide it into two days. You'll be exhausted, and you might regret rushing these nice places. My preference would be: 

Day 6:  Start at a nice cafe of your choice near Jongno-3-ga or in Insadong, then spend 3 hours looking around Insadong,
 galleries and shops, have lunch in Insadong, then taxi to Changgyeonggung palace for 2 hours. Will need another coffee, and then visit Bukchon Hanok village for about an hour. You will be exhausted by now, but reserve some energy that evening to explore Hyehwa-dong for restaurants, pubs, live music, and maybe street performances. 

Day 7: Cheonggyecheon stream, Gwanghwamun gate area, and Myeongdong shopping. 

Day 11 Lotte World, I'd skip it. Spend a day in a higher-end sauna / spa instead: https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=192812 | I would probably throw in a few hours around Seongsu-dong2-ga and the Seoul Forest into your itinerary.  2 weeks in Seoul seems long to me, but if you are stopping and staying for a long time in individual cafes that might be why.  I can’t sit still or stay in an area for too long, so a week in Seoul proper seems enough.  And yes, save Hongdae/Gwangjang Market/ Hyewha Street for nighttime. 

Is there a reason why explore Gangnam and Starfield library are on two different days?  Anything south of the river (Sinsa/Gangnam) should be done on one day.  You will lose a lot of time going back and forth.  

Bukchon Hanok Village was a let down for me.  Ikseon was better.  It’s very close to Jongno, the stream, and other spots as well.  I found myself on a long walk one day and hit up a bunch of these neighborhoods at once.  

Also, no palaces on your itinerary?  Or am I reading this wrong?  Hit up one or two!  They are beautiful places to walk around.","Feedback on 2 week seoul itinerary Hi everyone, I’ll be visiting Seoul for two weeks in late November (the start of the winter season), and I’d like to get my itinerary checked.

Day 15: Explore and chill around Sangsu Dong

Day 16:
To Incheon Airport I think it's important for people to state their ages when asking for feed back.

Day 2: rest.........

I can't imagine anyone less than 65 would want to rest on the first full day of being in a new country. | A lot of the days with specific times at specific places seem to be potentially tiring. I would suggest to avoid being too time-specific.

  
Hongdae comes alive a night only so I don't know if you will get to really experience that if you go there in the afternoon. But then I see you are spending like 2 hours at a cafe after dinner so I'm not sure if you'd be open to spending that time in Hongdae instead. | Have some breathing room. This level of scheduling seems tiring, no? | Day 6 has many interesting spots. I'd divide it into two days. You'll be exhausted, and you might regret rushing these nice places. My preference would be: 

Day 6:  Start at a nice cafe of your choice near Jongno-3-ga or in Insadong, then spend 3 hours looking around Insadong,
 galleries and shops, have lunch in Insadong, then taxi to Changgyeonggung palace for 2 hours. Will need another coffee, and then visit Bukchon Hanok village for about an hour. You will be exhausted by now, but reserve some energy that evening to explore Hyehwa-dong for restaurants, pubs, live music, and maybe street performances. 

Day 7: Cheonggyecheon stream, Gwanghwamun gate area, and Myeongdong shopping. 

Day 11 Lotte World, I'd skip it. Spend a day in a higher-end sauna / spa instead: https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=192812 | I would probably throw in a few hours around Seongsu-dong2-ga and the Seoul Forest into your itinerary.  2 weeks in Seoul seems long to me, but if you are stopping and staying for a long time in individual cafes that might be why.  I can’t sit still or stay in an area for too long, so a week in Seoul proper seems enough.  And yes, save Hongdae/Gwangjang Market/ Hyewha Street for nighttime. 

Is there a reason why explore Gangnam and Starfield library are on two different days?  Anything south of the river (Sinsa/Gangnam) should be done on one day.  You will lose a lot of time going back and forth.  

Bukchon Hanok Village was a let down for me.  Ikseon was better.  It’s very close to Jongno, the stream, and other spots as well.  I found myself on a long walk one day and hit up a bunch of these neighborhoods at once.  

Also, no palaces on your itinerary?  Or am I reading this wrong?  Hit up one or two!  They are beautiful places to walk around."

Part of the fun, and also a major anchor, for our travels are the very detailed travel itineraries I usually make. Not everyone's cup of tea, I get that, but we freeze when making on the spot decisions and we get hyped knowing exactly what we're going to be doing.

My itineraries usually include restaurants picked out for each of the meals we will be having. This ensures we don't miss out on any food we want try, and I can honestly say we've never had a bad meal on a holiday because of the extensive research I've put into picking food.

Now I think this will be a tricky thing to do in Korea, mostly because all food in Korea is just great in general, and there's literally thousands of places to eat at, which makes it difficult to research.

So what I want to do is maybe pick a couple of places that I really shouldn't miss, and for the rest of the meals I want to have some kind of general plan e.g. ""we're having bulgogi somewhere near Gwanghwamun square"".

Below is our wishlist of things we want to eat, and places we're looking to eat near. I would really appreciate some guidance on which thing to eat near where. Recommendations for actual restaurants are welcome too.

**Wishlist:**

Budae jjigae, Bulgogi, Samgyeopsal, K-BBQ, Fried chicken, Bossam, Chokbal, Galbi, Dakgalbi, Samgyetang, Kalguksu, Jajangmyeon, Sundubu Jjigae.

**Places we want to eat near:**

**Seoul** \- Gwanghwamun square, N seoul tower, Jogyesa temple, Seoul sky, Suwon rodeo street, Namsangol hanok village, Yeouido hangang park, War memorial of korea

**Busan** \- Gwangalli beach, Haeundae beach, Gamcheon culture village

**Jeju** \- Songaksan, Jeju folklore and natural history museum, Cheonjeyeon waterfall, Jeju natural world heritage center, Hyeopjae beach

And probably a far reach, but is there any place where we could eat gujeolpan?

*Markets we plan to visit, we may or may not eat at all of them:*

*Seoul - Namdaemun market, Myeongdong night market, Gwangjang market, Majang meat market, Noryangjin market*

*Busan - Jagalchi market*

*Jeju - Seogwipo maeil olle, Dongmun market*

Koryeo Samgyetang is good near Gwanghwamun. | By all means take a look and stroll through Myeongdong market but it’s gimmicky food stalls and not worth your time and money to eat at. Consider Mangwon market perhaps?

1jewszx,Would love some feedback on my Seoul restaurant picks in my 5 day itinerary (March 30 - April 3),4,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1jewszx/would_love_some_feedback_on_my_seoul_restaurant/,1742390431.0,"Travelling with a lady friend on a trip to Seoul next weekend. I've been to Seoul a few times but honestly haven't done too much touristy stuff (normally Korean friends show me around). Wanted to mix the eats with some high end and also some casual authentic local eats:

\*\*\*All restaurants/bars that can reserve ahead of time I have already done so but can easily cancel based on feedback)\*\*\*

Day 1 (March 30th Sunday)

\- Arrive Seoul at 2pm check in hotel likely at 4pm (hotel in Yongsan *area* near Itaewon and Myeongdong)

\- Pre dinner drinks: At Alice Cheongdam.

\- Dinner: Tasting menu at Born & Bred in Majang after for some delicious hanwoo beef.

Day 2 (March 31st Monday)

\- Brunch/snack: We'll spend the morning doing a Han River bike tour from Ttukseom Hangang Park to Seoul Forest and back. Will get some Chimeak (fried chicken & beer) in the park with the group to finish off the tour.

\- Light lunch: Was thinking after a morning of cycling we could do some nice chilled maengmyeon at Pildong Myeonok in Jung district.

\- Pre-dinner drinks: Zest in Gangnam

\- Dinner is TBD. Maybe some dinner nearby at Gangnam would be nice. Still thinking but open to suggestions.

Day 3 (April 1st Tuesday)

\- Light packed lunch: Head to Jinhae early morning and hike Jangboksan then check out the cherry blossom festival (will bring a bit of food to munch on during the hike or eat a bit after at the festival). Likely return to Seoul around 8/9pm.

\- Late dinner: Thinking of hit up Nari's House (나리의집) in Itaewon for some samgyupsal after we return to Seoul because it is only 15 minutes walk from our hotel and also open late (until 12am) so this gives us more flexibility since we could return a little late from Jinhae. Also after a long day of hiking we are the PERFECT clothes to be eating in at such a place (where you will smell like bacon fat afterwards...haha).

Day 4 (April 2nd Wednesday)

\- Lunch: Booked us a nice fine dining meal at Soigne (my lady friend with go for some beauty appointment after lunch in Gangnam so location is ideal).

\- Dinner: Lady friend said her face might be a bit red after beauty appointment so make sense not to go to a high end place. Doing something much more casual like piping hot jjigae (stews) at Ttukbaegi-jip *(뚝배기집*) in Jung district.

Day 5 (April 3rd Thursday)

\- Early lunch: TBD right now. Maybe even something simple like Gwangjang market or Namdaemun Kalguksu Alley for some local cheap eats before our flight. Alternatively we could do like Woomoolzip (우물집) in Changsin since that's a pretty good food and visually interesting restaurant. Can even do a quick coffee stop and walk around Ihwa Dong Mural Village afterwards. Be back to hotel before 1pm so we get to the airport before 2pm.

I've been to Seoul a few times but honestly haven't done too much touristy stuff (normally Korean friends show me around). Wanted to mix the eats with some high end and also some casual authentic local eats:

\*\*\*All restaurants/bars that can reserve ahead of time I have already done so but can easily cancel based on feedback)\*\*\*

Day 1 (March 30th Sunday)

\- Arrive Seoul at 2pm check in hotel likely at 4pm (hotel in Yongsan *area* near Itaewon and Myeongdong)

\- Pre dinner drinks: At Alice Cheongdam.

\- Dinner: Tasting menu at Born & Bred in Majang after for some delicious hanwoo beef.

Day 2 (March 31st Monday)

\- Brunch/snack: We'll spend the morning doing a Han River bike tour from Ttukseom Hangang Park to Seoul Forest and back. Will get some Chimeak (fried chicken & beer) in the park with the group to finish off the tour.

\- Light lunch: Was thinking after a morning of cycling we could do some nice chilled maengmyeon at Pildong Myeonok in Jung district.

\- Pre-dinner drinks: Zest in Gangnam

\- Dinner is TBD. Maybe some dinner nearby at Gangnam would be nice. Still thinking but open to suggestions.

Day 3 (April 1st Tuesday)

\- Light packed lunch: Head to Jinhae early morning and hike Jangboksan then check out the cherry blossom festival (will bring a bit of food to munch on during the hike or eat a bit after at the festival). Likely return to Seoul around 8/9pm.

\- Late dinner: Thinking of hit up Nari's House (나리의집) in Itaewon for some samgyupsal after we return to Seoul because it is only 15 minutes walk from our hotel and also open late (until 12am) so this gives us more flexibility since we could return a little late from Jinhae. Also after a long day of hiking we are the PERFECT clothes to be eating in at such a place (where you will smell like bacon fat afterwards...haha).

Day 4 (April 2nd Wednesday)

\- Lunch: Booked us a nice fine dining meal at Soigne (my lady friend with go for some beauty appointment after lunch in Gangnam so location is ideal).

\- Dinner: Lady friend said her face might be a bit red after beauty appointment so make sense not to go to a high end place. Doing something much more casual like piping hot jjigae (stews) at Ttukbaegi-jip *(뚝배기집*) in Jung district.

My daughter (26) and I (49) are hoping to be able to travel to Seoul next year, in 2026. We like shopping for things like stationery (we're nerds, okay?!), eye glasses, some clothing (not name brand), etc. We're also VERY excited to try some Korean foods like BBQ, fried chicken, tanghulu (?), etc. We're still unsure if we want to stay in an Airbnb or hotel. We don't want to spend more than about $140/night and want to be within about 3 minutes of transportation. Not into the party/bar scene and do want to take in some area attractions. 

What would the minimum amount of time we to check things out? 

We're also thinking of flying from Korea to Tokyo for at least a few days. 

We are also in the beginning stages of learning to read and speak Korean. ",7,Itinerary,"Based on your description it seems like northern Hongdae or Yeonnam and a guesthouse could work for you? As long as you avoid the southern part closer to Sangsu station you won’t notice the clubs really. And it’s perfect for streetfood, cheap clothes shopping, and cute accessories! I saw multiple places selling Tanghulu last May.  
  
To give some examples, here’s two guesthouses I have stayed at in Yeonnam and northern Hongdae. I assume you are fine with sharing a room with two beds?   
[Park Avenue Guesthouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EHoHTSpL5YZLPCPz5) - in Yeonnam, so super quiet at night but tons of restaurants and cafes around in day. And just a short walk to Hongdae. Exit 3 of Hongdae station is the closest. Maybe 10min walk along the park? So a bit more than 3min, but it’s so nice there I didn’t mind the walk at all. They also serve full Korean breakfast every day!  
[Hithere Guesthouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cx34uUDsTG7am6n37) - in northern Hongdae and right by so many of my favourite clothes stores! It’s a bit a way from the clubbing area, so you won’t notice that at all. And it’s just a few steps away from the Hongdae main shopping street. Exit 8 of Hongdae is maybe 5min walk away.   
  
If you want to see the historical areas or Myeongdong, both are just a quick metro ride away. Line 2 is by far the best metro line to stay near. | You’ll be able to have many options with up to $140/night for accommodation. I recommend staying near a subway station that has multiple lines running through it so it is more convenient to get to different areas of Seoul. Definitely download the kakaometro app and you can download naver or kakaomap to favorite locations and restaurants that you want to visit. Depending on your style of travelling and how rushed you want to be I think at least a week. If you don’t like to rush I recommend about one day per neighborhood, but half a day could be enough time at some places. Here are some neighbourhoods i recommend checking out: 
Hongdae: more than just clubs. Has some thrift stores, stationary, lots of clothes, I think I also saw an eye glass store, often has people busking.
Myeongdong: it is very touristy but also has many stores and a fun atmosphere. They also have a lot of trendy street food (that overpriced but good if you don’t have time in your itinerary to go to a market). 
Seongsu: this is Seoul’s up and coming neighbourhood. They have many pop up stores and trendy cafes. They also have some stationery stores/homemade looking items. 
Gyeongbokgung: definitely check out the palace and rent a hanbok. There is also a Korean folk museum which is really cool, palace museum, and national Korean museum of contemporary history (also really cool). I recommend going to the rooftop at the contemporary museum as you can see the palace really nicely. Across the street from this museum is a statue of the king that created Korean writing and a park that often has festivals and events 

I don’t really recommend Itaewon. I personally found it underwhelming. But it is nearby N Seoul tower and the Korean War museum so if you want to check out Itaewon you could stop in if you visit those places. | I will add that some guesthouses are great and the same quality or better than an Airbnb. But the process of reserving them isn’t as easy as Airbnb. I really struggled when trying to book a guesthouse because all of the nice ones were taken already.

I recommend checking out all three options and finding one that suits you best :) | Since OP is looking for 2026 they should be able to decide on any guesthouse and book it as availability opens :)   
I found guesthouses quite easy to book. There’s a lot available through Booking, which I mainly use. | True. If it’s really far out then probably easy to book. I used goshipages but not as far in advance","Trip to Seoul and Beyond Hi everyone,

1jictli,A June Foodie and History itinerary check for mom & teen,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1jictli/a_june_foodie_and_history_itinerary_check_for_mom/,1742772118.0,"Hi all, Me and my teen son will be traveling to South Korea for about three weeks in June. I was hoping to get some input on my draft itinerary.

**Context**

This is a multi-year birthday/Christmas gift so most of the itinerary is focused around my son’s interests: **food and history** (with a little **gaming** thrown in).

He’s neurodivergent and struggles when there’s **too much noise**. I’m a little nervous about how he’ll fare in Seoul. When we’ve visited major cities in the US where we live, he often gets overwhelmed by the very standard city noise. Same thing with carnivals and amusement parks. I think it’s gotten better in recent years, and he carries noise canceling headphones that help too.

He also enjoys going to **smaller restaurants** (think hole-in-the-wall mom and pop places that haven’t been updated in 50 years) and authentic (grimier) **flea markets**. We are NOT luxury travelers and we’re pretty comfortable in areas that some American tourists might think of as sketchy (which I know isn’t really a problem in SK like the USA).

We plan to use **buses & subway** for most travel within cities except where listed otherwise. Any travel we do between Seoul and Gyeongju or Seoul and Gongju will likely be done by KTX.

It’s also worth noting that my son prefers to do museums and the like on **speed-run mode**. It’s the opposite of my preferred museum-visit speed, so there may be some push-pull, but I doubt we’ll be longer than an hour in any specific Museum.

He also likes to have some **downtime** at the hotel. I have to be careful of how many days I’m scheduling back-to-back 6-10 hours of activity.

Logistical items I will have/get: International Drivers Permit, 1x T-money card (for me), 1x Wowpass (for him), local sim (both), bug spray, umbrellas (yes, we know we're going when monsoon season is about to start).

Before people encourage me to add **Busan/Jeju**, I’ve considered it, but I don’t think it’s worth adding to our trip. I’ve been to Busan before. It’s a very clean, modern city, but I honestly found the beaches and attractions I saw to be just kind of alright. I found it kind of frustrating with how spaced out it was and it just didn’t seem to have anything that will necessarily draw my son or I in.

While I personally would love to go to Jeju, I think my son will be kind of ambivalent about all the outdoorsy things I’d want to do. I also can’t justify the extra travel time compared to more space for him to really explore a closer historical place.



**Questions**

1. Any thoughts/tips on the undecided middle portion of my itinerary? Can those who have been to **Gongju/Buyeo or Fukuoka** give me some feedback on whether it’s worth keeping or dropping from the itinerary?
2. **PC Bang** \- I plan to get him a sim card with a local number to use in case it’s needed.
   1. He mostly plays Roblox. If he just brings it downloaded on a thumbdrive, is there anything else he’ll need to do?
   2. Any tips for protecting against account hacking/stealing using the public computers?
3. Does anyone know the usual timing of events on **Medicine Buddha day at Jogyesa Temple**? I wasn’t able to find anything online.
4. Other than galbi, bulgogi, and fried chicken places, what **food dishes/spots** would you recommend? I love a good soup, but it might take some convincing to get my son to give it a try.
5. Can anyone recommend a good evening \*group\* food tour in one of Seoul's markets for Friday night?
6. Any good **hanjeongsik** that you’d recommend in the cities on my itinerary? I don’t mind splurging on this one if it’s worth it (bonus points if we can reserve a private room, which my son would love).",8,Itinerary,"I'm a little confused.  He doesn't like crowds and you're going to the most crowded tourist sites in Korea? Is it that you're trying to challenge him?  | Why did you pick Korea over Japan?

Korea is cheaper but you are having a very stretched schedule so saving money doesn't seem like a concern for you. You can condense it to half the time, take your final segment in Seoul for example.

Japan is better for hole  in the wall kinda place. Some being mentioned on the Michelin guide.

I'd agree to omit Busan/Jeju. You are already travelling a fair amount. More travelling is just wasting time.

I think you are going to have alot of free time on your hands. Mom and teenage son usually don't have the same interest. Vs mom and teenage daughter that can spend half a day checking out skincare and cosmetics in 1 shop.

If it's a first time nothing wrong with checking out all the palaces. But it's highly repetitive in the grand scheme of things. For the non history enthusiasts out there it can get boring pretty fast. Added to the crowd haters you may not last as long in those places as you think.

Instead of ferrying to Fukuoka you can take a plane to Osaka for prob cheaper and certainly much faster. Then you have your spare time filled also between Osaka and Kyoto.

Do understand you are going to crowded areas. June is off season so it's not the worst. But it's still very crowded and that's unavoidable | Some feedback:

- The itinerary does seem jam packed, but I also see you’re trying to give your son options and he goes pretty fast so prob ok :)
- During any times you may split off from him, I’d suggest you try a jimjilbang to unwind!
- food to try: bibimbap, japchae, sujebi (found a wonderful long running restaurant called Samcheondong Sujebi near Gyeongbokgung Palace), tteokboki, seolleongtang (traditional beef soup- I think you’d like this), tteok guk, mandu, jjinppang, this place in Myeongdong called Myeongdong Kyoja that specializes in kalguksu (go to the one next to the Myeongdong subway stop and next to a Tous Les Jours), Korean BBQ, naengmyun, hotteok. | Hi!

I'm planning to spend about three days in Incheon at the end of my Seoul trip in mid-to-late April.

Most hotels seem to be clustered around 시민공원 (Citizen Park?). Ideally, I’d prefer somewhere central with good food options for a solo traveler, but if needed, I can make do with CVS food (ramyeon / chicken breast / tuna).

I'm trying to remember the shop that I regularly went to when I was an exchange student in 2019. 

- The location is near Ewha Woman's University Station 이대역 because I used to live near both Sinchon Station and Ewha Station and the shop is just walking distance from my place. It was likely in an alley, similar to the alleyway where the Ewha shopping spot is. 

- They sell variety of fried chicken and tteokbokki hot pot. 

- I was introduced to this place by my Singaporean friend because their chicken was halal. I saw many Malaysians tourists/students came to this store, so I think it was quite popular among the Malaysian Muslim community in Ewha? 

- The sellers are old couple. 

I found [this TikTok video](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSMd7KUDp/) that closely resembles my description, but I can't find the shop in Naver Map! Could it be that it's the correct shop but they have closed down? The TikTok was uploaded in 2022. 

I would really appreciate it if someone could help me identify this place since it was such a precious piece of memory I had while staying in Seoul.

I used to go there regularly too, and I don't recall the chicken restaurant being in front of the Thai restaurant. I am quite sure the Thai restaurant didn't move the location, so maybe the chicken restaurant might have moved there after 2019 - who knows... | Hmm, you’re right. Looking at the 2019 version of Naver Maps there was a different chicken restaurant then, called ”Chicky”. Then in 2020 it was instead ”양팡 Chicken”. It became Chicken The Home in 2021.   
  
If you have the time, why not walk around in the 2019 version of naver maps and see if you can find it? | Omg, I think it's 양팡 Chicken!!!! 

Thank you so much!!!

How do you change the Naver Map version, though? Can't seem to find the how-to online. Would love to walk around the 2019 map! | When you’re on the website, click the marker thing to enter street view mode. Then maximise the pop up window.

Assuming you’re on pc browser. If you’re on phone you need to download the app.

If you have the time, why not walk around in the 2019 version of naver maps and see if you can find it? | Omg, I think it's 양팡 Chicken!!!! 

Thank you so much!!!

How do you change the Naver Map version, though? Can't seem to find the how-to online. Would love to walk around the 2019 map! | When you’re on the website, click the marker thing to enter street view mode. Then maximise the pop up window. After that there will be a small bar just above the map preview in bottom left saying a year and a date. Click the bar to change year.   
  
Assuming you’re on pc browser. If you’re on phone you need to download the app.  
In the app you just tap on the street you want to see, maximise the street view preview, and the year bar will be at the bottom of your screen."

1gqy523,14 Day Itinerary,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1gqy523/14_day_itinerary/,1731563347.0,"Hello! I am a 24 year old female who’s about to go on her very first solo travel to South Korea in about 2 weeks. I will be staying there for exactly 14 days. As this will be my first time spending time in a different country, I am very anxious but I am very much willing to make the most of my trip.

My top priorities for this travel are to cafe hop, eat good food, do a bit of shopping, visit popular attractions and my favourite KDramas’ filming locations. As you will notice, I didn’t book popular day tours to Nami Island, DMZ, or Gyeongju. It’s because I want to save them for my next trip when I am with family or friends. For this trip, I want to do all the things I could do as a long time Kpop and Kdrama fan. 



DAY ONE (Busan)

- Arrival in ICN Airport 
- Departure to Busan
- Check In
- BIFF Square, Gukje Market, Bupyeong Kkangtong Market


My arrival time would be at around 8am and I’m eyeing a 12pm KTX train from Seoul to Busan. For dinner, I’m going to check those night markets listed above because they’re very near each other. I might skip Jagalchi Market because I don’t want to eat a heavy meal consists of seafood and spend a fortune on my first day. I want to try lots of street foods first thing!


DAY TWO

- Jeonpo Cafe Street
- Seomyeon Shopping Street
- Haeundae Beach
- Centum Spa Land


It isn’t too much for my first full day in Busan because I’m sure I’m gonna be tired af. I just want to check out Jeonpo and spend an afternoon to evening in Haeundae. I will also try the famous Sky Capsule and the Blue Line Train. Then end the day trying out the Spa Land. 


DAY THREE

- Gamcheon Village
- Huinnyeol Village
- Oryukdo Park & Sky Walk
- Gwangalli Beach


In Gamcheon Village, I am going to just walk around taking photos. In Huinnyeol Village, I will visit some cute cafes and little shops. I think I will spend more time in Huinnyeol Village and if I do, is it okay to skip Oryukdo Park and go straight to Gwangalli? Is there anything to do in Gwangalli? Or should I spend the rest of the afternoon in Oryukdo Park then an evening in Gwangalli? This is also my last day going around in Busan before heading outside Busan and back to Seoul.


DAY FOUR 

- Pohang Day Trip


I’m planning to spend the whole day in Pohang visiting the Hometown Cha Cha filming locations. I will probably be back in Busan at night and will have no time to go anywhere else rather than my airbnb and just rest.


DAY FIVE (Seoul)

- Check Out
- Departure to Seoul
- Bukchon Hanok Village
- Ikseondong Cafe Street
- Gwangjang Market
- Dongdaemun Design Plaza


I am taking the earliest KTX from Busan to Seoul. I want to be very early going to Bukchon Hanok Village and Ikseondong because I want to try on some cafes and restaurants. It is also a Sunday and I reckon there’s going to be a lot  of people there so there will be long lines for sure. Gwangjang Market is optional for this day because I’ve seen a lot of people not really recommending this market because of the crowd. But it’s near DDP so I might check it out if I have more time. 


DAY SIX

- Seoul Forest
- Seongsu


This day will be spent in Seongsu only. I will walk around visiting cafes and of course, shopping. I will also drop by SM Entertainment and Kwangya for some albums and merchandise!


DAY SEVEN

- Hannamdong
- Itaewon
- SBS The Show Tour (starts at 1pm)


The tour I booked starts at 1pm and the meet up location is in Itaewon. It also includes a tour around Itaewon so I thought it’s better to walk around Hannamdong in the morning while waiting for the tour.


DAY EIGHT

- MBC Studio Tour + Drama Rehearsal (ends at 3pm)
- Mangwon Market
- Han River


Another tour which starts early. After it, I am planning to drop by Mangwon Market to get some food and do a sunset picnic by the Han River!


DAY NINE

- Seokcho Lake
- Lotte World Adventure + Aquarium
- Lotte World Cinema


I will spend the whole day in Lotte World. I might stay until the night parade and maybe go watch a late night movie in Lotte World Cinema. I heard there’s a cool cinema called SPlex and I want to try it. But if I get too tired, I might try another cinema somewhere called CGV in another day or something. Also, do you recommend a good restaurant around Lotte World? It’s my birthday and I want to have a good birthday dinner!


DAY TEN

- Yonsei University
- Yeonnamdong
- Hongdae


I think a whole day is needed for these areas. It’s a Friday so I might stay until late evening to check out the night life there!


DAY ELEVEN

- Jeonju Day Trip


I am skeptical about this day trip because it’s a bit far from Seoul. Also there’s only a few Kdrama filming locations that I will visit here (Na Heedo’s house & the 25/21 tunnel). But I think I will regret it if I don’t go. There’s also a Hanok Village so I think it’s worth it to go because it’s the only hanok village that I will check out during the trip other than the Bukchon Hanok Village. Also, I’ve read Jeonju is an underrated city and it makes me want to visit more!


DAY TWELVE

- Suwon Day Trip


This is a must day trip for Kdrama fans. I will spend the day visiting a lot of Kdrama filming locations from Lovely Runner and Our Beloved Summer. I just don’t know what restaurant to visit or should I just grab some fried chicken because I saw that they have like a street full of fried chicken restaurants. But what if I don’t crave fried chicken on this day? 


DAY THIRTHEEN

- Pocheon Half Day Trip
- Gangnam


I am a huge Doctor Romantic fan so a visit to Doldam Hospital is a need. I will also drop by the Pocheon Art Valley and check out the blue (or green?) lake there. Is a half day manageable? Because I am planning to be back to Seoul early afternoon so I could go to Gangnam and visit the Disney’s 100th Anniversary Exhibit there.


DAY FOURTEEN

- Namsan Tower
- Gyeongbokgung Palace
- Gwanghwamun Square
- Deoksogung Palace & Stonewall


It is my last day and my flight will be at 11 in the evening so I still have of time to go around these spots. Though is it manageable?




Also, my airbnb is just 5 minutes walk to Myeongdong street so I could walk, eat, shop around Myeongdong until late at night everyday. If anyone has tips, advices, and suggestions, feel free to comment! I will gladly take notes. Thank you😌
",10,Itinerary,"My wife is Korean and we are currently visiting Seoul. We went to Gwangjang market today, and honestly skip it. It’s the closest to a “tourist trap” as it gets. Sure some of the food is really good, but prices are very inflated because of its popularity. 

If you’re still wanting to go, try to get there on a weekday between 14:00-16:00, usually a lot less people than peak times. | Found the only fantastic thing at Gwangjang is the coffee place. I found much better prices on things at Namdaemun. 

If you want to use time better in Suwon, be ready to use taxis. I only went to the ML house for OBS, even though I wanted to see more. Took a taxi there and found out it was across the street, literally faces Hwaseong fortress wall. The fortress wall was next on our list so we walked the wall, part of it. 

If you happen to be a fan of SITR, know that visiting a Coffee Bay is very difficult. Most were closed but we found one tiny place open. 

I don’t see Yonsei U on your list but I was glad we took a taxi to the main building at the top of the hill and walked down. Beautiful area. | I don't recommend Gwangjang Market. It's not a good idea. There are a lot of people, the prices are high, and the portions are small. Mangwon Market is much better.

Try the hotteok at Mangwon Market. It's delicious. If it's cold and you want warm soup, go to a place that sells chicken gomtang. You can eat a chicken soup dish that's good for the price. And right next to Mangwon Market, Mangridan-gil is famous for vintage clothes and cafes. Take a look around. It'll be really cold at the Han River. Be sure to buy a hot pack before you go. | Is there any reason to come back to Busan from Pohang? The route seems inefficient. | Speaking from my last trip a couple of months ago, Huinnyeoul Village is just not a hot place anymore. When I went, although it was in the middle of a heat wave, the place was really, really empty, and there were some kind of road works down on the Jeoryeong Coastal Walk, with huge cranes covering the sea views. The cafes were pretty, but you can find cute cafes almost anywhere else!

I can't speak about the Oryukdo Skywalk because I didn't go there, but I would personally spend more time in Gwangalli Beach. Over there the views are actually great and you will find much better vibes, especially if you are going on a Friday afternoon. And there are also some cute cafes on the higher floors, you can find them on Naver Maps.

And as some other comments have said: Gwangjang Market is not really worth it. You might get a better experience in Mangwon Market.

1k7qenc,Trip report Incheon,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1k7qenc/trip_report_incheon/,1745601416.0,"Just thought I would pass on some information about my recent experience, hope this helps someone.

Had a very short trip to Korea, last minute accompanying a friend for a conference (I only had 1 week notice). We stayed 4 days in Incheon and day tripped to Seoul.

I purchased an LGU esim for my phone upon arrival at the airport, which took only about 10 minutes, including waiting in line. It was about $19 for 4 days of wifi (no calling), which was ok for my needs. Verizon wanted to charge $12/day for their international service, so this was a nice compromise.

We took a taxi to our hotel which was easy. We exited the airport and went to the taxi platform which appears to be marked by zone. Since we were going to Incheon, we went to the sign with that city name on it, and a taxi pulled right up. We showed the name of our hotel written in Korean, and he repeated it back to us in English to confirm, and we were on our way. I think it was about $22 to the Oakwood Premiere in Incheon.

We used a combo of subway, walking and taxi. I downloaded the kride app before going and also have Uber. I found that most of the time Uber was the cheaper option and found the drivers to be more pleasant/polite (greeted me, sd thank you upon exit, kride drivers didn't say a word).

One minor issue we noticed: when taking longer subway trips (like our 1 hour 45 minute ride to Seoul), Naver would say things like “take Line 1 toward National University,” but that destination didn’t appear on the station signs. We had to cross-check the route by pulling up the subway map to see which direction included stops toward National University—just something to be aware of.

That said, the subway system is very clean, well-labeled (with English signage), and announcements are made in English too, which really helps.

Incheon was so clean with lots of restaurant options, and the parks are absolutely beautiful. Really great for early morning walks. The Songdo Hanok village is good for a walk through and to take pictures. There are many restaurants (we didn't eat at any). Singson Street between Convensia and Central was lively and had lots of eating options.

There are many coffee/pastry options available. My only issue is that I'm an early riser and would love to get a cup of coffee and a pastry earlier in the morning. Unfortunately, most coffee shops I found to not open until around 10 am, with a few opening at 9 am. There are some 24-hour chains places such as megacoffee, but they're more like kiosks, not nice coffee shops where you can go and sit.

The concierge at my hotel explained it was because people don't start work until later in the day (not sure if that's true as we saw many on the subway at 6am when we went to Seoul for the day). At any rate, be mindful of the morning situation. Speaking of the concierge, they were very helpful in finding the best way to navigate and also in finding shopping and restaurants. We stayed at the Oakwood Premier, which had stunning views of Incheon (the tallest building in the area)

Just plan on not much being open before 10 am. Even the Lotte Mart grocery store next to our hotel didn't open until 10 am. I guess you could say the benefit to the late openings was that most places stayed open later in the evening (like 11pm). So if you're a night owl, you'll love that.

That said, if I were planning another trip to Korea, I wouldn’t choose Incheon as one of my main stops. We made the most of our time there and had a great experience, but Seoul offered so much more in terms of cultural experiences, food, drinks, and overall energy. Beyond Seoul, I know there are even more incredible places to explore. We stayed in Incheon simply because we had free accommodations there—but if given the choice, I’d base myself elsewhere next time.

Papago translation was a lifesaver. We didn't eat at a single restaurant with an English menu (as a seasoned traveler, this is not a complaint in any way; we weren't expecting English, just a statement). We really tried to go to places where locals would eat and had AMAZING FOOD. Papago saved us, not sure how we would've communicated without it. That said, make sure to indulge in Korean BBQ—try all the sides, they’re incredible! Eat as much Korean fried chicken as you can get your hands on, and don’t miss out on staples like kimbap, jajangmyeon, and bibimbap.

We only had one day in Seoul, and it was incredible—definitely wish we’d had more time. One thing that stood out was how early everything opens. We arrived around 7:45 AM and found plenty of coffee shops and restaurants already bustling.

We visited Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden—both beautifully preserved and absolutely worth it. Just a heads-up: the Secret Garden requires a separate reservation at least 6 days in advance, or it’ll likely be sold out. Don’t miss it—it’s peaceful, lush, and stunning.

Unfortunately, Gyeongbokgung Palace was closed the day we visited, but we still had a great time exploring. It rained the whole day, but the silver lining was far fewer crowds!

We visited both Ikseon-dong and Insadong, and each had its own charm. Ikseon-dong was full of cafes and boutique shops tucked into narrow, hidden alleyways. The blend of traditional hanok architecture with a modern twist made it super photogenic—great for food and atmosphere.

Insadong, on the other hand, had more craft and souvenir shops, plus plenty of places to buy traditional teas. For us, it was Ikseon-dong for food and Insadong for shopping.

I really wanted to get in on some Kbeauty purchases, but really didn't have enough time to research exactly what I wanted to buy. I was able to use Papago at Olive Young to ask questions about my skin type and they had good recommendations. Wish I would've had more time to shop around and explore different stores for beauty products, but Olive Young was great for last-minute shopping.

One last note about Incheon Airport (ICN)—it has two terminals that are about 20 minutes apart, so make sure you go to the correct one. I took a Kride taxi from my hotel (for my departing flight) and asked the driver, “Korean Air?”—but got no response. I then used Papago to say in Korean, “My flight is international on Korean Air. Is this the right terminal?” Still, no reply.

Eventually, he pulled over and motioned for me to get out. I wandered around the terminal for about 20 minutes—completely exhausted from the short trip, jet lag, and long days of sightseeing—before I finally asked the information desk. They told me I needed to go *outside* and take the white shuttle bus labeled 'Terminal 2'.

It took another 20 minutes to reach Terminal 2. That mix-up cost me nearly an hour, so I was very thankful I had arrived at the airport three hours early. Just a heads-up for anyone flying Korean Air: they use Terminal 2!

Four days was way too short for a trip to Korea, but I’m so glad I went. My friend had to work for two of those days, so I explored on my own—and as a female traveler, I felt completely safe the entire time. These reflections are simply based on our personal travel experience over the three full days we had to explore, and aren't meant to spark debate or controversy—just sharing what we observed.

Please don’t expect everyone to accommodate your language needs. While we found Koreans to be incredibly kind and helpful, most didn’t speak English in the places we visited—and that’s perfectly okay. We didn’t expect them to, and made an effort to communicate using Korean and a translation app, which was part of the experience.

There are plenty of Western-style malls and restaurants if you’re more comfortable in English (though we didn’t visit any), but I really encourage you to step outside your comfort zone. Embracing the local culture made the trip so much richer—you won’t regret it.

I hope this helps....happy & safe travels!",1,Trip Report,Yeah I agree on the coffee shop hours is was torture waiting for 10:00 am to roll around especially with time adjustment. 😂,"Trip report Incheon Just thought I would pass on some information about my recent experience, hope this helps someone.

- Amazing tangerine soba. You won’t have this anywhere else. I consider this life changing because of how unique this pairing is. It’s an eye opener on what such a dish combination is like.

TIA again!",2,Itinerary,"I'd recommend contacting your specific hotel about late check-in; it looks like you're arriving around midnight and I'd hate for your room to be forfeited if the hotel has a policy about that. I'm planning to do that for mine (and I'm arriving at like 8pm which is probably overly careful on my part)

I've heard 3 hours for arriving at Incheon, and my departing flight is around the same time as yours. I've also heard that smartpass isn't actually that helpful and a lot of the time everyone ends up in the same line anyway, but if others have had different experiences please correct me! | Great post of the detailed itinerary.

**Question: I understand its also popular to picnic at Seoul Forest Park, but how easy is it to rent picnic gear / are there many wooden tables that can be used for picnicking?**

General question: We are bringing a stroller for our kids - I understand not all train stations in Seoul have elevators. Am wondering if it is possible to check in advance online which train stations do not have elevators?  
Last question: How many hours in advance do we need to arrive at Incheon Airport for our flight back at 1120 AM? I had read previously that some people recommend 3hours in advance but if we use the SMARTPASS would it help much?

TIA again! I'd recommend contacting your specific hotel about late check-in; it looks like you're arriving around midnight and I'd hate for your room to be forfeited if the hotel has a policy about that. I'm planning to do that for mine (and I'm arriving at like 8pm which is probably overly careful on my part)

I've heard 3 hours for arriving at Incheon, and my departing flight is around the same time as yours. I've also heard that smartpass isn't actually that helpful and a lot of the time everyone ends up in the same line anyway, but if others have had different experiences please correct me! | Great post of the detailed itinerary. Have you done the trip? Please post a trip report."

I lived in China town/Ktown in the states so I want something that would really amaze me.

I have a list of food that I like and want to find the best restaurants that serve it with the best quality and freshness. Or a restaurant that specializes in making the dish. Location don’t matter as long as I can reach it by metro.

2. Spicy stir fried Octopus
3. Seafood Pancake
4. Beef Tofu Stew
5. Galbi Dolsot
6. Bibimbap Dolsot 
7. Korean Black Bean Noodles
8. Korean Fried Chicken (I like Soy Garlic)

Also does anyone know any good high quality KBBQ place for solo travelers? (Doesn’t need to be AYCE)


Any good Chinese places? 
Any place serve Spicy Cumin Lamb hand pulled Noodle (like Xian Famous food In NYC)?
Also how is the Din Tai Fung here? Never had it so want to have a good first impression of it.

I’m also a fan of seafood. So any seafood restaurant? 

Any fine dining/ Michelin Star restaurant worth going? 


Thank you! 🙏 


",9,Food and Drink,"I just went recently and one of the chefs at the kbbq restaurant recommended Hyodo Chicken for fried chicken, it was started by two michelin chefs, one of which is currently at Mingles (two stars). They have some unique flavors, but the one I loved the most is the Kwari Myul flavor (soy glazed with fried anchovies and peppers). I also tried the spicy one with fried lotus roots.

For fine dining, I visited the following:
- Soul dining
- Mingles
- born and bred (20+ course hanwoo beef omakase)
- jungsik 

I'd recommend both Mingles and Born and Bred.

For seafood, the only place I visited was Crab52 (AYCE buffet), but I felt the selection was rather limited for the hefty $200 price. | Very often the best restaurants are just neighborhood joints, not the famous places most tourists will know about. | My tip is to learn the Korean names of what you're looking for and learn how to read Korean letters and copy basic spelling. Then when you are there, use Naver in Korean and only pick places above 4.5. You will get waay better search results in Naver if you can use Korean. You don't even need to try to understand Korean that well, just learn the letter system and the names of the food you want. 


Also, without the Korean names of some of the food, I'm not sure what you are trying to find. What is beef tofu soup? 

For a unique country-style take on bibimbap, try this place: Sigol Yachae Dwenjang  시골야채된장

For a really good and simple 짜장면 Jjajangmyeon, try Ha Won 하원  in Insadong. Their jjambbong 짬뽕 is also good.

Eta: 북촌 몽중헌  Mong Joong Heon in Bukchon is a pretty hot spot for Chinese. It's more authentic than Korean Chinese. I had some dumplings and jjambbong and they were quite excellent. It is a fancier restaurant, so plan accordingly. 

I'll also echo what someone else said - Korean Chinese food is its own category. Don't expect it to be more authentic just because they are closer to China. I really recommend looking for as old fashioned Korwan home cooking as you can find. That's where the magic is!

Lastly, here is a recommendation for Han Woo beef. It was really delicious: 장수하늘소 Jangsu Haneul So

It can be windy and cold. But it will be not that much cold because it is not winter yet. Don't forget to bring a jacket!


2. Most food like tteokbokki include some sugar. But you can still find some food that is not sweet. Salad, porridge, Fried chicken etc


3. I don't think there are many low quality meat. But there can be some kbbq giving you meat with so much fat especially in tourist spots.. | 1. Yes

2. Maybe

3. Yes

4. Don’t worry about this. Not even a little 

5. —-

6. Maybe you are traveling for the wrong reasons if you think it’s even funny to joke about that. | 1. It’s finally starting to cool down but is still so hot here right now! A light jacket and a couple sweaters should do the trick.

2. See above, it’ll probably be 50s in the morning, maybe 70s as a high.

3. You can find literally all kinds of food in Korea. I can link some good recs if you’re visiting Seoul.

4. Find places with good ratings on Naver maps. Will link below. I usually avoid street food for cheaper sit down places. Bonus if they have an English menu!

5. I recommend learning to make gimbap (like Korean sushi) or kimchi from scratch! Or any kind of bulgogi dish.


6. Lmao 0/10 do not recommend but live your life"

Jongno is closer to the main tourist spots and it's well connected to the rest of the city. Depending on the area it can be very crowded or less crowded.

Hongdae is youth! :) It's crowded at night, but it has super nice vibes, I love it even if I don't like clubbing, etc. But it will require you to take more trains some days. But on the other side it's directly connected with the AREX to the Incheon Airport which is always convenient.

As it's your first time and with a little kid, being in Jongno could be a little bit more comfortable to visit the main tourist spots and very easy go back to hotel if necessary.

1heoyrl,Seoul trip report from a western family - things we wish we knew travelling with a child. ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1heoyrl/seoul_trip_report_from_a_western_family_things_we/,1734254179.0,"This will get heavily downvoted, yet I wish we knew this as a western family who visited Seoul with a child. 

There are no dogs and no children in Seoul. I have an idea about the dogs, but I’m unsure why there aren’t any children. All the kids we saw were tourists, there are no local children. There are no parents with prams, no playgrounds indoors or outdoors, no kids cafe’s, no kids menu’s. No pregnant people, no schools that we saw. Advertising also aims everything at 13-year old girls and up, there’s nothing we saw for younger children. This is such a sharp contrast to places like Oslo for example.

Doors - no automatic doors. Rotating doors are as close as you get to automation. For all others you either need to press a tiny, hidden button on the door to enter and again to exit, or you need to push the door by hand to physically swing it open. And these doors are big and tall, there’s no mechanism to make it easier to swing. Even when entering premium shopping centres - you still need to swing these massive doors open, usually one after another. Imagine that with a pram. 
In some countries locals are afraid of their photo being taken - I’m now convinced Koreans are afraid of automatic sliding doors. 

Busses - these race off the line and then emergency break to stop. Don’t imagine standing and not holding. Don’t imagine standing and holding just with one hand - you’ll be flying. And the issue is not just the rate of acceleration, it’s that this acceleration is not linear: they speed up as fast as they can, then change gear, then speed up again right up to the point when they need to do an emergency break to stop at the station. You’re being thrown around the bus constantly and unpredictably. 
Plus they do not stop close to pavement for no reason. There is space, they could, but they don’t. 

Pavements are unnecessarily steep for no reason and some have extreme side tilts - they could level off these areas in the same way as they have levelled off the roads for cars, but they don’t. It’s a challenge with a pram and impossible on a push chair - you’ll flip on a side and roll away. 

Lifts on public transport - it’s very hit and miss, some are present in metro but generally that’s all. You will not find travel in Seoul seamless. 

Food - everything is tasty but food hygiene is not to a western standard: raw & cooked chicken stored close together for example. Looks like this area is not as regulated or not enforced. There are a few 24h places where you cook your own meat - these are great, and the concept is superb, called gogigui. 

Hotel breakfast was amazing: great variety of western food (hot and cold), Asian food plus we had cooked to order omelets and noodles. Seoul does not look like a breakfast city so hotel breakfast was a very good option, there aren’t many alternatives otherwise, not like New York or Milan or Paris. 

Local rules - swimming caps are required in the pool when the same 5-star luxury hotel chain in other countries doesn’t need it. Must be a local thing. 

English - they really don’t know it when they say they don’t. If the person says little English, they literally know “yes”, “no” and “little”. So if you ask them “yes?” - they’ll say “yes”. When you ask “no” - they’ll say “no”. And when you ask “English?” - they’ll say “little”. Anything else and they have no idea, look completely stunned. In Europe when someone says “little English” you end up having a 5-min conversation about the country, the city, the food and the weather, easily understanding each other with basic sentences. I suggest you learn one word at least - An’yong (hello). It wakes people up, they bow their heads and usually are impressed you know something in their language.

Payment systems - cards with pin stop working as payment terminals cannot ask to verify the pin. ATMs are hit and miss - some show transaction error, others give cash ok (Mastercard). For example had a card for me and the wife - same bank, same account type, same card type - mine failed with errors, but her card worked in the same atm. Then mine worked at a different bank 20 min later. My card was newer (6 months old), hers was 2 years old - that’s the only difference. When trying to pay for vending machines, my bank reported that I used an incorrect pin, despite never entering a pin at all. Be careful so the card does not get blocked by accident…

Mobile service is the best we’ve ever seen in the world. KT network worked everywhere - metro, shopping centres, basement floors, elevators, museums, etc. There wasn’t a place without a full signal anywhere - I don’t know how they pull it off, but it’s amazing to be connected like that. As a result, phone battery lasted much longer too. 

Navigation - NAVER app is the way, kakao has most things in Korean where’s NAVER translated common review tips, shows the type of the place in English, etc. 

T money is OK but strange you can only top it up with notes of 1000 won or more: when a shop gives me change, like 500 won, I cannot top up tmoney with it. At the same time a bus journey can cost 1,400 won so why not allow smaller denominations for top up?

Shopping centres - these are well organised and each floor has its own theme, like luxury on one floor, technology on another, trendy clothing and shoes somewhere else. And they can be on floors 8 to 12 for example, not just around the ground floors. Strange but good. ",26,Trip Report,"Wow, you sound fun to be around! | Annyeong is very casual. It could sound impolite especially for people who you don't know. Please use annyeonghaseyo. | This was clearly your first time visiting Asia if all you’re comparing Seoul to are all western/European cities. Your definition of breakfast also clearly isn’t the same as Asia’s definition of breakfast. | Just a bunch of condescending biased bullshit | You sound like the kind that give other western tourists a bad name.","Seoul trip report from a western family - things we wish we knew travelling with a child.

There are no dogs and no children in Seoul. I have an idea about the dogs, but I’m unsure why there aren’t any children. All the kids we saw were tourists, there are no local children. There are no parents with prams, no playgrounds indoors or outdoors, no kids cafe’s, no kids menu’s. No pregnant people, no schools that we saw. Advertising also aims everything at 13-year old girls and up, there’s nothing we saw for younger children. This is such a sharp contrast to places like Oslo for example.

Doors - no automatic doors. Rotating doors are as close as you get to automation. For all others you either need to press a tiny, hidden button on the door to enter and again to exit, or you need to push the door by hand to physically swing it open. And these doors are big and tall, there’s no mechanism to make it easier to swing. Even when entering premium shopping centres - you still need to swing these massive doors open, usually one after another. Imagine that with a pram. 
In some countries locals are afraid of their photo being taken - I’m now convinced Koreans are afraid of automatic sliding doors. 

Busses - these race off the line and then emergency break to stop. Don’t imagine standing and not holding. Don’t imagine standing and holding just with one hand - you’ll be flying. And the issue is not just the rate of acceleration, it’s that this acceleration is not linear: they speed up as fast as they can, then change gear, then speed up again right up to the point when they need to do an emergency break to stop at the station. You’re being thrown around the bus constantly and unpredictably. 
Plus they do not stop close to pavement for no reason. There is space, they could, but they don’t. 

Pavements are unnecessarily steep for no reason and some have extreme side tilts - they could level off these areas in the same way as they have levelled off the roads for cars, but they don’t. It’s a challenge with a pram and impossible on a push chair - you’ll flip on a side and roll away. 

Lifts on public transport - it’s very hit and miss, some are present in metro but generally that’s all. You will not find travel in Seoul seamless. 

Food - everything is tasty but food hygiene is not to a western standard: raw & cooked chicken stored close together for example. Looks like this area is not as regulated or not enforced. There are a few 24h places where you cook your own meat - these are great, and the concept is superb, called gogigui. 

Hotel breakfast was amazing: great variety of western food (hot and cold), Asian food plus we had cooked to order omelets and noodles. Seoul does not look like a breakfast city so hotel breakfast was a very good option, there aren’t many alternatives otherwise, not like New York or Milan or Paris. 

Local rules - swimming caps are required in the pool when the same 5-star luxury hotel chain in other countries doesn’t need it. Must be a local thing. 

English - they really don’t know it when they say they don’t. If the person says little English, they literally know “yes”, “no” and “little”. So if you ask them “yes?” - they’ll say “yes”. When you ask “no” - they’ll say “no”. And when you ask “English?” - they’ll say “little”. Anything else and they have no idea, look completely stunned. In Europe when someone says “little English” you end up having a 5-min conversation about the country, the city, the food and the weather, easily understanding each other with basic sentences. I suggest you learn one word at least - An’yong (hello). It wakes people up, they bow their heads and usually are impressed you know something in their language.

Payment systems - cards with pin stop working as payment terminals cannot ask to verify the pin. ATMs are hit and miss - some show transaction error, others give cash ok (Mastercard). For example had a card for me and the wife - same bank, same account type, same card type - mine failed with errors, but her card worked in the same atm. Then mine worked at a different bank 20 min later. My card was newer (6 months old), hers was 2 years old - that’s the only difference. When trying to pay for vending machines, my bank reported that I used an incorrect pin, despite never entering a pin at all. Be careful so the card does not get blocked by accident…

Mobile service is the best we’ve ever seen in the world. KT network worked everywhere - metro, shopping centres, basement floors, elevators, museums, etc. There wasn’t a place without a full signal anywhere - I don’t know how they pull it off, but it’s amazing to be connected like that. As a result, phone battery lasted much longer too. 

Navigation - NAVER app is the way, kakao has most things in Korean where’s NAVER translated common review tips, shows the type of the place in English, etc. 

T money is OK but strange you can only top it up with notes of 1000 won or more: when a shop gives me change, like 500 won, I cannot top up tmoney with it. At the same time a bus journey can cost 1,400 won so why not allow smaller denominations for top up?

Shopping centres - these are well organised and each floor has its own theme, like luxury on one floor, technology on another, trendy clothing and shoes somewhere else. And they can be on floors 8 to 12 for example, not just around the ground floors. Strange but good.  Wow, you sound fun to be around! | Annyeong is very casual. It could sound impolite especially for people who you don't know. Please use annyeonghaseyo. | This was clearly your first time visiting Asia if all you’re comparing Seoul to are all western/European cities.
