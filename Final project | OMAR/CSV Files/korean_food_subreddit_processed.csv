Whenever anything broke, he would always find a way to fix it or repurpose that thing into something else. 


Kimbap was no exception. We would egg fry old kimbap and make this dish as a treat whenever it had been sitting in the fridge for too long. My mom would make this weekly so that we could eat kimbap we took from church on Sundays and eat it all week without feeling like we were eating the same meal. Not going to lie, sometimes I got sick because we let the kimbap sit in our fridge too long. But I loved it and it made up a big part of what I ate as a kid.

He is heavily autistic and it's just a battle. 

Well, I found the trick.. I made a Korean dish and he actually sat down and finished his entire plate and then asked for more. Asked if I could make it again soon. I happily agreed!

Him and I are the only ones in the house that will eat Kimchi so I make him a rice bowl with kimchi and an egg almost every morning for breakfast.

- bbibimbap
- kimchi fried rice

- fried fish, rice and soup
- all kinds of jeons (small savory pancakes you fill with meat, fish or veggies)
- kimchi pasta (fusion‚Ä¶sauteed kimchi with some type of pork and butter until translucent, make or add pasta sauce, peas, anything else you like‚Ä¶add a little sugar. use long noodles or large pasta shapes‚Ä¶tastes fabulous)
- spinach side dish is delicious (garlic, sesame oil and seeds

1gox23u,I made Kimchi! ü§©,407,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gox23u,1731344470.0,"Hi! üòä

I made Mat Kimchi (cut cabbage kimchi). I used the recipe from Su Scott's lovely cookbook called Rice Table: Korean Recipes and Stories to Feed the Soul ü§©. 

I followed the recipe, but I did use a bit more than the 1.5kg Chinese cabbage that was stated. The man who runs the shop I bought them from said, ""The Chinese cabbages are ¬£1.99 each, so make sure you choose the biggest ones ü§£!"" So I chose two big ones, but ended up with a little too much ü´£. This meant that I added a little extra to all of the other ingredients. Hopefully it has all turned out well. ü§ûüèæ

I treated myself to two E-Jen fermentation containers. They are for kimchi, sauerkraut and pickling etc. You can use them for brining, fermenting and storage. 

I bought a 1.7L one and a 3.4L one. The one in the pic is the 3.4L one. The size is deceiving, I didn't think that all the kimchi I made would fit in that one alone. I thought I'd have to use both. It fit in it with room to spare, so that's fab! üòÄ 

I dont usually like plastic, but they come recommended. My main reasons for buying the containers was that they are meant to help with containing the smell more üò≤. I also bought them as they have the inner lid that acts in place of fermentation weights. You press it down on the contents. I'll see how I get on with them. üëÄ

Next I'm going to make Kkakdugi (diced radish kimchi). üòÄ",32,Kimchee!,"Looks good!

It's usually ok to keep the cabbage leaves whole while making it, then cut it up before eating. I do personally like the size you've cut them at though! | üî•üî•üî• | Looks amazing! | [removed] | Mind sharing your recipe?! Thank you!!","I made Kimchi! ü§© Hi! üòä

‚Ä¢ 1¬†cup¬†Korean coarse sea salt, 
‚Ä¢ 5¬†cups¬†water
‚Ä¢ 1¬†pound¬†Korean radish,

‚Ä¢ 3 - 4¬†raw shrimps, about 2 ounces, finely minced or ground¬†- optional
‚Ä¢ 3¬†tablespoons¬†minced garlic
‚Ä¢ 1¬†teaspoon¬†grated ginger

Instructions
1. sprinkle salt over the thick white part of each leaf. Try to salt all the cabbage quarters with 1/2 cup salt, but you can use a little more if needed. Repeat with the rest of the cabbage quarters. 
Set aside for about 1 hour, 

2. The cabbages should be ready to be washed when the white parts of the leaves are bendable. It's okay to have a bit of resistance. Rinse thoroughly 3 times, especially between the white parts. Drain well, cut side down

3. Meanwhile, make boiling water in 1cup of water, and mix the rice flour with 1/2 cup water and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to a thin paste, and let it sit to cooldown. 

4. Cut the radish and pear into matchsticks (use a mandoline if desired) in a large bowl. Cut the scallions diagonally into about 1-inch long pieces. Add the prepared seasoning mix to the radish, and mix well by hand. Throw in the scallions, and mix everything lightly. Taste a little bit. It should be a little too salty to eat as is. You can add salt, 

5.  Spread the radish mix over each leaf and add it to the kimchi container. Leave it out at room temperature for a full day and store in refrigerator. | No... it's grandma's kimchi = best kimchi...

I used the water from when I washed the rice instead of chicken stock. I had it as a blueprint but didn't follow the amount of ingredients religiously.

Here's the recipe:
Ingredients
- 400g (14 oz) diced pork belly
- 2 tbsp peanut oil
- 3 spring onions, white part sliced about 2cm thick, green part finely sliced
- 1 yellow onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, diced
- 500g (17.6 oz) kimchi with the juice

- 2 tbsp gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 500ml (17 fl oz) chicken stock
- 300g (10.5 oz) tofu
- rice, to serve

Method
1. Begin by placing a large pot over medium-high heat and add the peanut oil and diced pork belly. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring often, before adding the onions, garlic, and kimchi. Stir well and continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes.
2. Now add the white parts of the spring onions, sugar, salt, gochugaru, gochujang, and chicken stock. Stir well, cover the pot, and let it simmer over medium-low heat for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 5-10 minutes.
3. Remove the lid, add the sliced tofu, then replace the lid and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Garnish with the green parts of the spring onions and serve with steamed rice. | Nice presentation | Recipe? | That is sounding so good.

2. Now add the white parts of the spring onions, sugar, salt, gochugaru, gochujang, and chicken stock. Stir well, cover the pot, and let it simmer over medium-low heat for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 5-10 minutes.
3. Remove the lid, add the sliced tofu, then replace the lid and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Garnish with the green parts of the spring onions and serve with steamed rice. | Nice presentation | Recipe? | That is sounding so good.

Buchu (Î∂ÄÏ∂î) are garlic chives, not quite the same as our chives, but can be substituted if you can't find buchu.

In French you're looking at oignon vert or oignon nouveau (green onion), ciboule (spring onion), poireau (leek), ciboulette, cive, or civette (chives), and ciboulette chinoise (garlic chives).

The foto shows Leeks and that is not really Daepa in Korea. Daepa is thicker and toller green onions. Leeks are a lot thicker and tougher than Daepa and cannot be used for garnishing like Daepa. It is also hard to be found in Korea.

Chives and Buchu are also slightly different. Chives are tube; Buchu is flat. Buchu is called Garlic Chives in English.
Edit: when a Korean recipe calls Buchu as ingredient, it is 100% Garlic Chives. | [deleted] | In the US, for Korean food, the first one is scallions/ green onions, which are the most common and available everywhere. 

The second one is the Korean pronunciation of leek (make k a second syllable ke). It's common in American grocery stores and western cuisine but not common in Korean food. The large green onion, dae-pa, is the very commonly used Korean ingredient.  It has the same hollow green part like green onions, unlike the flat and very tough green portion of leeks. A young daepa is call shilpa (Ïã§Ìåå, ""thread"" onion). They are called  bunching onions or Welsh onion in English 

The third one is Western chives. But Koreans use garlic chives , bu-chu. Labeled garlic chives or Korean chives in Asian markets. Some sell Chinese chives, which are longer/wider than the ones labeled Korean chives.

The only thing I can suggest based on what little we have to go on is to use more oil and cook at a lower temp. More oil means more contact so the edges won't look so white and underdone. You'd basically be shallow frying them in oil, similar to [this video](https://youtu.be/eAEc-lnIQhw?si=NeKEvdYH6aR7ECND&t=98).

Lower heat means more time to get the nice colouring of 4 o'clock and avoid almost burning 1 o'clock and 8 o'clock and you won't get such an obviously small circular patch that you have with 1 and 6.

1dwa2r1,Went to a Korean market and found some cool things ‚Äî what would you do with these?,220,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dwa2r1,1720217801.0,"Browsed this store before coming back for actual shopping. These were some of the novel things I‚Äôd never seen before. Do yall buy any of this and how do you prepare it? Is any of this in my pictures worth buying? 
",77,Shopping Time üõç,"1 - This price! Buy as much as you can eat! It's like a sweeter canteloupe when fully ripe, but a honeydew-canteloupe hybrid when a bit underripe.  

5 - If you haven't had any of the kimchi brands shown before, get a small jar first and see if you like it enough to get more. Perfect snack on its own or over plain rice, but the possibilities are endless. Pancakes, jigae, fried rice, grilled cheese‚Ä¶  

6 - Daikon radish: Can pickle on its own (perfect side for fried chicken) or with carrots/other veggies.  

11 - Korean tuna: Gimbap. The yellow can is supposed to taste better than US tuna brands, but haven't tried before.
Silkworm pupa: Um, some people love it. I think you can roast them. If you're an adventurous eater, why not?  

13 - That's probably too much of a good thing. Sweet, tangy, creamy, but they typically come in much smaller single-serve portions for a reason.  

16 - These are dessert-in-a-can.
Cinnamon flavor is A LOT. Very sweet, like leftover cinnamon toast crunch cereal milk packed with even more cinnamon and sugar. Even one small can overwhelms the palate.
Rice milk is nice, not too sweet. Does contain actual cooked rice grains, so just be wary of the potential choking hazard.  

17 - Would skip. Get the tuna in the yellow can, or even just US tuna, and buy a separate tub of gochujang. Mix to your taste. Again, for gimbap.

18 - Kobe beef: Would skip unless you already have something specific in mind. Too pricey to impulse buy and do it justice, in my opinion.

19 - Pork belly is great for lettuce wraps or jigae/other soups.

I'm honestly jealous of the variety and prices! | Not everything is Korean, but this is certainly a well-stocked Korean market.

1. Hami Melon. Also known as Rock Melon. Taste sweeter than Cantaloupes. Very good. Peel, remove seeds, slice it up, and eat.

2. Sugar Cane. (More Chinese / SEA food really) Eat it as it. Biting off the peel and biting off small bits of the inside and chew to extract the sweetness. When it is no longer sweet, spit it out. Squeeze / compress it to extract the juice. Sweet and refreshing. Really good with a splash of lemon. Not recommended because you need a special roller / compressor type of machine to extract the juice. Lastly, you can process it to extract cane sugar or syrup.

3. Top half are Burdock. Braise and slow cook till it is soft. Usually used as ingredient in a gimbap. Bottom half are Chinese Yam or Japanese Yam. Chinese will peel it and use it in clear soup or use it in a stir-fry. Japanese will grind it and eat the resulting paste with rice and soy sauce. Another way Japanese use it is grind it and mix it with egg to make tamagoyaki (egg roll).

4. Habanero. No explanation needed. Not Korean or Asian. I guess they carry it because of some habanero eating challenge going around a while back.

5. Kimchi. Eat it as-is as a side dish. Make Kimchi jeon with it. Make Kimchi jjigae with it. The possibilities are endless.

6. Radish. This is likely Chinese Radish. Korean Radish and Japanese Radish look different. Chinese will use it mostly in clear soup or stir-fry. It can be processed into ""carrot cake"" ËêùÂçúÁ≥ï (not to be confused with the dessert carrot cake that non-asians are familiar with).

7. Korean Sea Tangle AKA Kelp AKA Konbu. Use it to make soup stock. Add a small piece when making other soup or making rice to add umani flavour. (Remember to fish it out and not let it cook too long in soup as it might become bitter).

8. Perilla Seed. Grind it or use it as-is as condiments for soup. Adds a unique nutty flavour that is different from sesame seed.

9. Sesame Seed. Similar to Perilla Seed but more widely used as topping or condiments on more types of dishes. Every Korean food can use a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds. The spicy flavoured one is probably meant for spice fiends.

10. Shredded dry chilil. Mostly used as a garnish.

11. Silkworm pupa AKA Beondegi. Eaten as-is out of the can as a drinking snack.

12. Sweeten Red Beans (the one in the photo is Japanese). Used as fillings or toppings in various hot and cold desserts. Used in Korean, Japanese and Chinese desserts.

13. Yoghurt drink. No explanation needed. Sweet, sour, a favourite of kids.

14. Various banchan. Side dishes to go with your meals. Can be use to make bibimbap or gimbap.

15. Salted jellyfish. Used for making cold salad with some greens, acorn jelly (dotori muk), thinly sliced onion and a refreshing dressing typically made with vinegar and gochugaru or just use kimchi water as a salad dressing.

16. On the left, Sujeonggwa (Korean Cinnamon dessert drink). On the right, Sikhye (Korean Rice dessert drink). Old school canned drink version of traditional Korean dessert drinks. Refreshing and yummy.

17. Tuna with gochujang. No explanation needed. Canned tuna pre-mixed with gochujang. Use how you would use regular canned tuna.

18. Beef. Grill as-is and eat it. Dip it in a mixture of sesame oil, salt and black pepper. You can also make a ssam (vegetable wrap) with it, with lettuce, garlic, ssamjang and some banchan.

19. Pork belly. As above. | You‚Äôve never seen habaneros, sesame seeds, canned tuna or steak before? ;-)

I suggest looking at websites like maangchi.com for Korean recipes and then going to the store and buying what you need | 1. I had this for breakfast, it‚Äôs indistinguishable from a cantaloupe and is on mega sale this time of year.

2. There is no ramyun but Shin. And if you‚Äôre looking at sugar cane, I have no idea.

3. Yams are yums.

4. I think you know what to do here.

5. This is the part where you buy the overpriced kimchi then go back next time for ingredients to make your own.

6. So very may cool things can be done with radishes! Animate them as a Japanese god. Eat them in a stir-fry, mandoline them and quick-pickle for a little taco wrap.

7. Nope, you don‚Äôt have time for that. Many soaks.

8. I‚Äôm curious too. Perilla leaves are one of my favorite foods. But this isn‚Äôt a farm store, these aren‚Äôt ready-to-plant. I‚Äôd love to hear.

9. You‚Äôve got this.

10. Garnish! So pretty.

11. Fucking what? Although I‚Äôd snag some of that Korean tuna, Maangchi swears by it and it has a bulletproof jacket keeping it separate from canned larvae.

12. The label is in Japanese. It says sweet adzuki. If you‚Äôre a fan of halo-halo, it‚Äôs a great mix in. I don‚Äôt like halo-halo, but 115 million Filipinos/as will disagree with me.

13. Tooth rot! You know those desserts that form the tongue scum because they‚Äôre too sweet and you‚Äôre all mortified that you‚Äôre in public and not by your toothbrush? Like Yakult.

14. Try all the banchan at least once. My white-girl ass had no idea marinated Korean fish cake was her favorite food. Not sure what to do with pollack roe, but the veggie ones are easy.

15. I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. It‚Äôs labeled in crappy generic English and crappy generic katakana, which leads me to strongly believe that this came from a tank somewhere in China. Given their lax approach to graphic design, I‚Äôd pass.

16. No idea. Pass the soju, please.

17. Now that is a GREAT idea! Can you imagine the lunchboxes and gimbap you could make!

18. You know what to do. If you‚Äôre contemplating Kobe beef, you know how to cook a steak. If you haven‚Äôt practiced on a lesser steak, now‚Äôs the time.

19. What can‚Äôt you do? Hot pot. KBBQ, marinated or not. Do the thing with the domed grill and the veggies lower than the pork so the fat drips down into the veg. Take it as an excuse to backtrack to the kitchen supply section and get a new butane table-top grill or bbq scissors or more tongs. One cannot own too many pairs of tongs. | #2 If the store juices the sugarcane, get it juiced!  Sugarcane juice over ice is summer in a cup for me!  It's also great used as  skewer for meats!  In Vietnam we use it to make shrimp skewers to eat with bun.  

#3 is burdock! Burdock is used mostly for tea where my family is from.  If you have a dehydrator it's easy to make your own dried burdock root for tea.  It's also good in a stir fry, or braised.  It's full of good for you  nutrients!","Went to a Korean market and found some cool things ‚Äî what would you do with these? Browsed this store before coming back for actual shopping.

 fucking what although id snag some of that korean tuna maangchi swears by it and it has a bulletproof jacket keeping it separate from canned larvae

 the label is in japanese it says sweet adzuki if youre a fan of halohalo its a great mix in i dont like halohalo but  million filipinosas will disagree with me

 tooth rot you know those desserts that form the tongue scum because theyre too sweet and youre all mortified that youre in public and not by your toothbrush like yakult

 try all the banchan at least once my whitegirl ass had no idea marinated korean fish cake was her favorite food not sure what to do with pollack roe but the veggie ones are easy

 i dont know what to do with this its labeled in crappy generic english and crappy generic katakana which leads me to strongly believe that this came from a tank somewhere in china given their lax approach to graphic design id pass

 no idea pass the soju please

 now that is a great idea can you imagine the lunchboxes and gimbap you could make

 you know what to do if youre contemplating kobe beef you know how to cook a steak if you havent practiced on a lesser steak nows the time

 what cant you do hot pot kbbq marinated or not do the thing with the domed grill and the veggies lower than the pork so the fat drips down into the veg take it as an excuse to backtrack to the kitchen supply section and get a new butane tabletop grill or bbq scissors or more tongs one cannot own too many pairs of tongs    if the store juices the sugarcane get it juiced  sugarcane juice over ice is summer in a cup for me  its also great used as  skewer for meats  in vietnam we use it to make shrimp skewers to eat with bun

Hey folks. I live in America and am trying to get better at using American ingredients in Korean foods. My CSA (veggie farm share box) has ended and I was trying to use up some veg from the early fall haul before they went bad.

The temp dropped today, so I made a dolsot bibimbap with brown rice, carrots, swiss chard namul, purple onions (hiding under the egg), mushrooms, eggplant jjim, gochujang chicken thighs, an egg, some green onions, and some ground up sesame seeds.

Served with kimchi that I made about three months ago (it's still pretty mild though), an acorn squash salad (done up sort of like Korean potato salad), and some danmuji (all out of frame).

The rice got a nice crisp to it! | Lovely work! | Why did I read that as autism dolsot bibimbap ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | I'll also go home and make delicious bibimbap üòÑ | That looks delicious","Autumn dolsot bibimbap  (Sorry, but I have no idea how to get text to post.)

1dfhg9v,The degradation of Korean ingredient and food quality,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreanFood/comments/1dfhg9v/the_degradation_of_korean_ingredient_and_food/,1718335818.0,"I grew up with a grandma that made her own soy sauce, doenjang, and gochujang, She crushed and roasted her own sesame seeds, Dried her own vegetables, Roasted her own gim, would take off the tails of the kongnamul, and gutted and cleaned a months worth of myeolchi 

And I get that not everyone had this. And I get that it's old school and a lot of it has become obsolete. 

When she passed my mom and family did what many Koreans did and bought premade versions of all of that. 

And it was fine. We def noticed a quality difference but it was still good 


But now? I honestly can't even recognize  a lot of premade Korean things. I recently went to the store to buy soy sauce and even the most expensive, highest quality soy sauce now has high fructose corn syrup in it.

And most premade Korean soy sauces have gluten in them.  Why? 

Even the classic  ramyeon we used to get (neoguri and shin) are different. The noodles are diff and the taste is off. 

The dduk gook dduk you get now is such terrible quality. You boil it for five minutes and it falls apart. 

Gochujang is soooo sweet. I remember growing up and hearing that gochujang could be Ïßú and now? It's not really a thing anymore. 

And doenjang? lacks  depth of flavor. 

It makes me frustrated that the commercialization of Korean food has turned to this. 

As korean food continues to gain popularity I hear a common comment that Korean food is so sweet. 

But it shouldn't be. That shouldn't be the takeaway after one eats a Korean meal. 

 And, I don't know, it makes me sad. 

Call me an ÏïÑÏ†ÄÏî® or what not but I just didn't think that the foods that I eat would end up getting the same treatment as  American processed foods. 

That's my rant. Sorry. 

Tldr: get off my ÏûîÎîî ",65, Traditional,"Ask around and you will find people making things in home and selling them if you don‚Äôt have the time to make it yourself, usually a Korean church with old ladies. | Well, hopefully you got your grandma‚Äôs recipes. | I'm thinking they're having to cheap out on gochujang because gochu is EXPENSIVE. A family member got a Î∞©ÏïóÍ∞Ñ to grind peppers and got 4 regular sized plastic bags' worth of gochugaru for 60ÎßåÏõê. Hahaha it's crazy.

Some tips I've learned over the years:

1. For gochujang, look at the gochugaru content. The cheap crap will have hot sauce instead of gochugaru. The slightly better ones will have gochugaru but low content. The decent ones will have 20%+ gochugaru.

2. For doenjang, I don't remember if it was ÏÉòÌëú but there's a brand that sells different levels. IIRC, level 1 is super mild and level 3 is alright. Dunno if there are higher because level 3 is the highest that the store near us ever imported. When I crave stronger doenjang, I eat cheonggukjang. It's not perfect but it's way better than nothing.

3. For ramyun, yeah there's been changes that made a lot of people unhappy. Someone mentioned MSG removal. For US export versions, all the beef flavors are left out because the US doesn't import Korean beef. No way around it unless you find someone that's personally snuck in real Korean versions. | Mass produced is never the same for anything as home made, for better or for worse.  

Are you going to start making the stuff yourself, then?

My grandma also made everything because of necessity.  War,  poor, huge family to feed. Japan's style of soy sauce usually has gluten because roasted wheat was crushed into the soy. So if your ancestors learned things during the occupations, they probably made soy with wheat. And I definitely do not want to live in the same place where meju is made and stored. My grandma made SO. MANY. BLOCKS to make enough gochujang and doenjang to distribute regularly to her 8 grown daughters. None continued making the ingredients themselves even though they knew how. SO. MUCH. WORK. SO. VERY. STINKY. üòÜ 

I understand you're feeling nostalgic for your grandmother's foods. Your family decided not to carry on that work, so here you are. | There is gluten in soy sauce¬† cause they add wheat.


Ramyeon tastes different because they removed msg after a misinformed public outcry.


Ddukguk ddeok is still high quality if you thought to get it from a local Î∞©ÏïóÍ∞Ñ (mill).


Gochujang is less salty because of the public awareness for the harmful nature of high-sodium diet. Back then when most people had to perform manual labour they required lots of sodium to compensate for loss due to sweat.


Doenjang still has great flavour if you make it at home.


I actually don't get why you are griping when you're not even trying to make shit yourself. Mass produced things.are obviously going to be different from home made things. Also your palate is fresh and sensitive as a kid, and they dull as you get older.


Stop complaining and do something about it.


Put a pinch of ÎØ∏Ïõê in your ramyeon.


Get non-mass-produced Ïû•. Better yet, make it yourself.","The degradation of Korean ingredient and food quality I grew up with a grandma that made her own soy sauce, doenjang, and gochujang, She crushed and roasted her own sesame seeds, Dried her own vegetables, Roasted her own gim, would take off the tails of the kongnamul, and gutted and cleaned a months worth of myeolchi 

And I get that not everyone had this. And I get that it's old school and a lot of it has become obsolete. 

When she passed my mom and family did what many Koreans did and bought premade versions of all of that. 

And it was fine. We def noticed a quality difference but it was still good 


But now? I honestly can't even recognize  a lot of premade Korean things. I recently went to the store to buy soy sauce and even the most expensive, highest quality soy sauce now has high fructose corn syrup in it.

And most premade Korean soy sauces have gluten in them.  Why? 

Even the classic  ramyeon we used to get (neoguri and shin) are different. The noodles are diff and the taste is off. 

The dduk gook dduk you get now is such terrible quality. You boil it for five minutes and it falls apart. 

Gochujang is soooo sweet. I remember growing up and hearing that gochujang could be Ïßú and now? It's not really a thing anymore. 

And doenjang? lacks  depth of flavor. 

It makes me frustrated that the commercialization of Korean food has turned to this. 

As korean food continues to gain popularity I hear a common comment that Korean food is so sweet. 

But it shouldn't be. That shouldn't be the takeaway after one eats a Korean meal. 

 And, I don't know, it makes me sad. 

Call me an ÏïÑÏ†ÄÏî® or what not but I just didn't think that the foods that I eat would end up getting the same treatment as  American processed foods. 

That's my rant. Sorry. 

Tldr: get off my ÏûîÎîî  Ask around and you will find people making things in home and selling them if you don‚Äôt have the time to make it yourself, usually a Korean church with old ladies. | Well, hopefully you got your grandma‚Äôs recipes. | I'm thinking they're having to cheap out on gochujang because gochu is EXPENSIVE. A family member got a Î∞©ÏïóÍ∞Ñ to grind peppers and got 4 regular sized plastic bags' worth of gochugaru for 60ÎßåÏõê. Hahaha it's crazy.

Some tips I've learned over the years:

1. For gochujang, look at the gochugaru content. The cheap crap will have hot sauce instead of gochugaru. The slightly better ones will have gochugaru but low content. The decent ones will have 20%+ gochugaru.

2. For doenjang, I don't remember if it was ÏÉòÌëú but there's a brand that sells different levels. IIRC, level 1 is super mild and level 3 is alright. Dunno if there are higher because level 3 is the highest that the store near us ever imported. When I crave stronger doenjang, I eat cheonggukjang. It's not perfect but it's way better than nothing.

3. For ramyun, yeah there's been changes that made a lot of people unhappy. Someone mentioned MSG removal. For US export versions, all the beef flavors are left out because the US doesn't import Korean beef. No way around it unless you find someone that's personally snuck in real Korean versions. | Mass produced is never the same for anything as home made, for better or for worse.  

Are you going to start making the stuff yourself, then?

My grandma also made everything because of necessity.  War,  poor, huge family to feed. Japan's style of soy sauce usually has gluten because roasted wheat was crushed into the soy. So if your ancestors learned things during the occupations, they probably made soy with wheat. And I definitely do not want to live in the same place where meju is made and stored. My grandma made SO. MANY. BLOCKS to make enough gochujang and doenjang to distribute regularly to her 8 grown daughters. None continued making the ingredients themselves even though they knew how. SO. MUCH. WORK. SO. VERY. STINKY. üòÜ 

I understand you're feeling nostalgic for your grandmother's foods. Your family decided not to carry on that work, so here you are. | There is gluten in soy sauce¬† cause they add wheat.


Ramyeon tastes different because they removed msg after a misinformed public outcry.


Ddukguk ddeok is still high quality if you thought to get it from a local Î∞©ÏïóÍ∞Ñ (mill).

Ingredients:
Kimchi(xtra juice)
Linguine
Steak or Pork Belly
Garlic
Chives
Mushrooms
Onion
Butter
Fresh Parmigiano Romano 
Bread

-I started by cooking my pasta, once it was done I set it aside and made sure to save 1-1.5 cups of the pasta water. 
-While my pasta was cooking I saut√©ed the garlic(about half a bulb), a small white onion, and about 3/4 of a pack of mushrooms. Once done I set them aside. 
-When I was waiting I 1)grated by full block of cheese(I don‚Äôt have the exact amount, about $10 worth) and 2)Prepped my kimchi. I used about 1.5-2 cups and then used my saved kimchi juice to cover it. I used scissors to chop it into big chunks just so there weren‚Äôt any huge pieces. Set both of these aside. 
-I let my steak sit out to get closer to room temp so I could cook it rare and get it how I like it. I only seasoned it with course salt. Cooked on one side for about 2 minutes. Added a spoonful of butter and 1/4 a bulb of garlic to the pan and flipped it. Cooked to another two minutes on that side. Set aside to rest. 
-I cooked the asparagus with a bit of olive oil and sea salt. Set aside. 
-THE SAUCE: A pint of heavy cream into a pot with 3/4 of the cheese(set aside 1/4 for topping the pasta and making the bread). A spoonful of butter. Medium heat. Let it get melty. Added less than a spoonful of corn starch to thicken it just a bit before adding everything else. Added all my kimchi with the extra juice. Added all the veggies. Added some finely chopped chives, person preference there. Added my cut up steak. Let it get nice and hot. Then added the pasta a bit at a time to make sure it got all mixed up and coated evenly. Let it sit in low to medium heat for about ten minutes while I cooked the bread. 
-Bread. I bought a loaf and sliced thick slices. Mixed butter and a bit of the remaining cheese and spread it on the bread. Cooked it in a pan at medium high heat until crispy and flipped it until both sides were crispy and to my liking. 
-Final product. Moved my pasta to a bowl, topped with some of the remaining cheese and parsley. Added a slice of bread and some of the asparagus. 

SO GOOD. | I'm not a chef, but I'm pretty sure this recipe is the answer to world peace... or at least my hunger | Holy crap that looks amazing! | Koreans love cream pasta, just add some sugar and you could get this on the menu of every pasta restaurant in Seoul. | Don't suppose you have a link to a recipe?

Korean Fried Chicken

INGREDIENTS

1 small yellow onion, coarsely grated

2 cloves garlic, minced

¬Ω teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for coating

¬º teaspoon black pepper, plus more for coating

8 to 10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, quartered, or 24 wings

3 tablespoons gochujang

3 tablespoons ketchup

¬º cup granulated sugar

2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, more for garnish

Juice of ¬Ω lemon

Oil for deep frying

¬Ω cup all-purpose flour

‚Öî cup cornstarch

PREPARATION

1. In a medium-size bowl, combine grated onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Add chicken and toss to coat well. Cover and set aside to marinate for about 1 hour.
2. In a large bowl, stir together gochujang, ketchup, sugar, sesame seeds and lemon juice. Taste and adjust flavors to get a spicy-sweet-tangy finish. Set aside.
3. Pour oil into a large heavy pot to a depth of 1¬Ω inches. Heat to 350 degrees. Combine flour and cornstarch in a shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper.
4. Working in batches to avoid crowding, lift chicken from marinade, dredge lightly in seasoned flour and cornstarch, gently drop into oil and fry for 5 to 7 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining chicken, checking oil temperature between batches.
5. For wings only, when all pieces are done, increase oil temperature to 375 degrees and refry in batches for 30 to 60 seconds, until very crisp. Drain once more on paper towels. 
6. While chicken is still hot, brush all pieces thickly with chili sauce. Serve hot, sprinkled with sesame seeds.","Korean Fried Chicken and Oi Kimchi  How did you do the korean fried chicken sauce? | Which one is my plate?

Oyster sauce and Gochujang in the kimchi sause is also off putting to say the least. 

Garlic and ginger are aromatics, the larger portion  are onions though, which are missing completely. Green onions are just added bulk and garnish.

With no fishsauce and saeujeot, a lot of flavour depth and umami will be missing.

The base for the common standard kimchi sauce is often sweet rice flour porridge because it is the main food source for lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation process. Sugar or some fruit is added to kickstart the process not to make it less spicy.

Winging or customising a recipe is fine, but the changes should at least make some sense.

And you're not going to get that kind of mix in a tiny bowl that's already filled to the brim.  Well you might, but it might take a while and stuff's gonna fall over the side.

And you're not going to get that kind of mix in a tiny bowl that's already filled to the brim.  Well you might, but it might take a while and stuff's gonna fall over the side.


Anywho, this was brought to you by all the bibimbap pics lately that had me going: how's that going to ÎπÑÎ≤º? [deleted] | lol I was thinking of commenting when I saw the bibimbap pics posted earlier with the really small bowls.

This reminds me of the Filipino shaved ice dessert halo halo (literally means ""mix mix""). It's always shown [served in tall glasses, filled to the rim](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=e3ff2cacd83f1ace&sxsrf=ADLYWIKB00ApJs38jKuiLCkxMV4yBSnRJQ:1722359364907&q=filipino+halo+halo&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0AbzhUJjXv6jRup8eVc0BvPyH5PazCaW205cG-Bd0in0SeU-Q4GVbDidOCCAlv8ddwnuh7lPh3aYhqMJdmlhqKO8rDglsPvyMjbq9rCVLJ_yLz05yoyCj0IoTno93uYggnfsWN1FM92F-TFvqgBlLlmP8zrNwNJEd3LcLFp9n7dqviEvbckZCE_JI4OCNw2SzCBq6GPkqgWkri4s4r_BLQYM2Jsmw&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjGt_vQoM-HAxUrk4kEHTPJDBIQtKgLegQIDxAB&biw=1536&bih=809&dpr=2.2), so you can see all the colorful ingredients, but it's impossible to mix everything together like you're supposed to without spilling everything and making a mess. I know it won't look as aesthetically pleasing, but you really need a giant bowl. At home, I use the same giant metal bowl for halo halo as well as bibimbap. lol | I like dolsot bibimbap.

Ïó¥Ïã¨Ìûà ÎπÑÎ≤º! | Also you need to chop the ingredients on the small side. You see too many people putting huge chunks of meat and veg into their bbb. You want things small so you get a good mix in each bite.

Also you see a lot of people adding kimchi to their bbb. While this is fine, usually kimchi is not added to BBB but served on the side.

Also final fun fact, even though people always translate BBB to ""mixed rice"", techincally it means ""rubbed rice"".","pro tip for you all when making bibimbap serve it in the biggest bowl you own

lol how much did you make   if you reheat in the microwave double the time and half the power reheats way more evenly this applies for anything frozen btw not just japchae ever since i stopped blasting everything at full power in the microwave reheated food has become so much better   yes you can freeze reheat on a pan with olive oil","['freeze', 'japchae', 'japchae', 'vegan', 'veggie', 'dish', 'pan', 'smoked', 'tofu', 'strip', 'additional', 'protein', 'side', 'note', 'arm', 'workout', 'givin', 'mix', 'household', 'wont', 'able', 'next', 'freezable', 'tip', 'leafy', 'veg', 'spinach', 'spinach', 'dish', 'vegetable', 'home', 'itll', 'mean', 'freeze', 'fry', 'fresh', 'spinach', 'pan', 'ideal', 'household', 'wont', 'able', 'next', 'microwave', 'power', 'applies', 'anything', 'frozen', 'btw', 'everything', 'full', 'power', 'microwave', 'reheat', 'pan', 'olive', 'oil']"

# Ingredients (for 2 sandwiches)

**For toasts:**

* Toast bread¬†‚Äî¬†2¬†slices (it's best to use Brioche bread)
* Butter¬†‚Äî¬†60¬†g
* Dill¬†‚Äî¬†2¬†tbsp
* Granulated garlic¬†‚Äî¬†2¬†tsp

**For filling:**

* Egg¬†‚Äî¬†3¬†pcs
* Bacon¬†‚Äî¬†6¬†slices
* Milk¬†‚Äî¬†40¬†ml
* Sugar¬†‚Äî¬†1¬†tsp
* Salt¬†‚Äî¬†¬Ω¬†tsp
* Sunflower oil¬†‚Äî¬†1¬†tsp

**For spicy sauce:**

* Sriracha¬†‚Äî¬†1¬†tbsp
* Mayonnaise¬†‚Äî¬†1¬†tbsp

**For cheese sauce:**

* Cheese¬†‚Äî¬†30¬†g
* Milk¬†‚Äî¬†40¬†ml
* Butter¬†‚Äî¬†30¬†g
* Granulated garlic¬†‚Äî¬†2¬†tsp
* Cornstarch¬†‚Äî¬†1¬†tspIngredients | Those look delicious, thank you for sharing! | Craving something like this in Phoenix! Wonder if they sell this anywhere here | # How to make:

1. Beat 3 eggs in a bowl until smooth. Add salt, sugar and room temperature milk and mix well.
2. Pour some sunflower oil into a frying pan and heat over low heat. Pour in the egg mixture and start stirring gently with a spatula along the bottom of the pan until the entire mass has set (same principle as making scrambled eggs). Divide the resulting omelet into 2 parts and remove from the heat.
3. Clean the pan, reheat it over medium heat (without oil) and fry the bacon slices. Blot the cooked bacon with paper towels to remove excess fat.
4. In a small bowl, combine the Sriracha sauce and mayonnaise (1:1 ratio) to make a hot sauce. We will use this sauce to spread on the toast. Sriracha can be replaced with any other chili sauce you have on hand.
5. Now start making the toast. Melt 60 grams of butter in a separate bowl, add chopped dill and granulated garlic, and mix well. Spread 2 slices of bread on both sides with this flavored butter.
6. Reheat the pan over low heat. Cook the buttered bread until golden brown (about 2 minutes on each side).
7. When the bread is done, make a nick in one side so that the toast can be folded into a corner and stuffed. Be careful not to cut the toast all the way through (I used a spatula to do this).
8. Now make the cheese sauce. In a skillet over low heat, combine the butter and garlic powder. Add the cornstarch and milk and mix well. Increase the heat to medium and add the grated cheese while stirring. Remove from heat when cheese is melted.
9. Assemble the toast. I used a small box (this is how they serve this type of sandwich in Korea), but you can just lay the toast out on a plate. Brush the bread with the hot sauce first (save some to garnish), then place 3 slices of bacon and cheese sauce on top and cover with the omelet. Drizzle with the remaining hot sauce and decorate with chopped dill.

I am 52 now and THRILLED at how much more common and popular Korean food is. But what id like to know is how did White peoples taste and smell change so much in 30 years? For the first >20 years of my American life, my white friends would literally gag at the smell of kimchi...now it's fine? Im just curious as to how that happened?",183,questions,"Social media and k-dramas. | https://preview.redd.it/2hetb4j2b9nd1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcfc9abc0e5aca7e7bf9da11325f5a7a09866b84

It's all thanks to the internet. | So, I am not white, but I am also not Korean. My take on this is that it in ways tracks with how immigration and perception of those immigrants has played out in the past. The newest wave of immigrants is always seen as outsiders and usurpers. Even looking at a hundred years ago - there was huge bias and racism against Italian and Irish people when they were entering Ellis Island in large numbers. I think there was a point in time where spaghetti was an incredibly foreign and ""strange"" food. I think that as time goes on, and as those people become more woven into the fabric of the cultural landscape, aspects of those cultures also become more normalized and widely accepted.

I'm not sure which part of the country you live in, but I have also heard that it is also very different if you grew up in a large, urban area with a larger Asian population, and I have heard that there is also a huge difference in mindset of and regard towards Asians on the West Coast vs the East Coast. It sounds like people have always been more largely accepting of Asian people and Asian culture on the West Coast because more people naturally immigrated and settled through there, so there are more and larger Asian communities.

I think also that Korean food and Korean culture has seen a rapid rise in the mainstream as other parts of culture, such as music, tv, and beauty, have gained more recognition globally.

Now Korean food is part of the cultural zeitgeist of late. I‚Äôm guessing Korea‚Äôs cultural export is to blame. Netflix and online music streaming made it easier to watch and listen to Korean stuff. When you‚Äôre watching Kdrama with kimchi and other Korean food all the time, you‚Äôre probably more willing to try Korean food.

But what id like to know is how did White peoples taste and smell change so much in 30 years? For the first >20 years of my American life, my white friends would literally gag at the smell of kimchi...now it's fine? Im just curious as to how that happened?

It's all thanks to the internet. | So, I am not white, but I am also not Korean. My take on this is that it in ways tracks with how immigration and perception of those immigrants has played out in the past. The newest wave of immigrants is always seen as outsiders and usurpers. Even looking at a hundred years ago - there was huge bias and racism against Italian and Irish people when they were entering Ellis Island in large numbers. I think there was a point in time where spaghetti was an incredibly foreign and ""strange"" food. I think that as time goes on, and as those people become more woven into the fabric of the cultural landscape, aspects of those cultures also become more normalized and widely accepted.

I'm not sure which part of the country you live in, but I have also heard that it is also very different if you grew up in a large, urban area with a larger Asian population, and I have heard that there is also a huge difference in mindset of and regard towards Asians on the West Coast vs the East Coast.

That type of rice cake (keep in mind there are lots of different varieties) is not supposed to be sweet. For me, these are really nice when I want something that‚Äôs not too sugary or rich. The soft texture and subtle nuttiness is really nice, especially when you get it fresh. 

It‚Äôs like if you‚Äôve only had sweet breads your whole life and then one day you try a really good piece of whole wheat bread. You‚Äôd probably think it‚Äôs flavorless too. | Aside from the fact that its a ricecake (which is not my first choice as a vehicle for dessert) I feel like its mainly its a cultural thing. Korean foods generally speaking, don't have lots of sugar so it tracks that their snacks/desserts taste bland if you didn't grow up eating it. 

In my head its akin to korean bbq shortrib marinade homemade vs at a AYCE where its (imo) got way more sugar than it needs, to the point that its like sickly sweet. Anyone out there that grew up eating  mothers homemade galbi knows exactly what I'm talking about. | EXCUSE YOU? 

Kidding aside, it's called injeolmi. The powder on the outside is roasted soybean powder. It's sort of known in Korea as an ""adult's taste"" kind of food -- not super intense, but sort of understated and hearty. I suggest chewing the tteok for a long time and thoroughly - the starch will convert into sugar (maltose) in your mouth.

That type of rice cake (keep in mind there are lots of different varieties) is not supposed to be sweet. For me, these are really nice when I want something that‚Äôs not too sugary or rich. The soft texture and subtle nuttiness is really nice, especially when you get it fresh. 

It‚Äôs like if you‚Äôve only had sweet breads your whole life and then one day you try a really good piece of whole wheat bread. You‚Äôd probably think it‚Äôs flavorless too. | Aside from the fact that its a ricecake (which is not my first choice as a vehicle for dessert) I feel like its mainly its a cultural thing. Korean foods generally speaking, don't have lots of sugar so it tracks that their snacks/desserts taste bland if you didn't grow up eating it. 

In my head its akin to korean bbq shortrib marinade homemade vs at a AYCE where its (imo) got way more sugar than it needs, to the point that its like sickly sweet. Anyone out there that grew up eating  mothers homemade galbi knows exactly what I'm talking about. | EXCUSE YOU? 

Kidding aside, it's called injeolmi. The powder on the outside is roasted soybean powder. It's sort of known in Korea as an ""adult's taste"" kind of food -- not super intense, but sort of understated and hearty. I suggest chewing the tteok for a long time and thoroughly - the starch will convert into sugar (maltose) in your mouth.

1e4ke9h,How to make fluppy steam eggs,103,https://i.redd.it/gr9crbbnoucd1.jpeg,1721122435.0,What makes steam eggs so fluppy? I never eat such a type of a egg dish before! ü•∞ü•∞,28, Traditional,"Bros accent coming through the internet üíÄ | Here's my recipe:

Get a bowl in a desirable size for the amount of egg that you want to eat that and find a pot that the bowl can completely fit inside. Fill the pot with about a 1/2 to 3/4"" of water. Bring the pot of water to a boil.

While the water is heating, add a little bit of water or dashi stock to the bowl and crack your desired amount of eggs into the bowl, whisk well. Optional: You may add misc. chopped veggies, seafood, etc. into the egg mixture.

Once the water is boiling, lower the entire bowl with the egg mixture into the pot, and reduce the heat to medium-low (you want the water to be gently simmering, if the water is too hot the egg will turn green and/or the egg will over-expand and then deflate, resulting in an undesirable texture).

Every few minutes, gently stir the egg with a spoon until you see some egg starting to firm up.

Drizzle a bit of sesame oil on top, and cover the pot with a lid.

The egg will be done when you shake the pot and the egg has a firm jiggle but does not move like water anymore. Turn off the stove, and gently take the egg bowl out of the pot (you may need a hot plate gripper, or you can use a clean dish rag to protect your hands from the hot surface).

Top with sesame seeds and chopped scallions.

You can do this recipe directly in a pot or ÎöùÎ∞∞Í∏∞, but I feel that the double boiler method yields the most delicate egg souffl√©. For the one that you have pictured, it was likely made in a sheet pan to make several servings at once, but at home you can make it directly in the bowl that you'd like to eat out of. | ...fluffy? | Egg+water (or flavored broth), usually prepared in ceramic bowl similar to the one that has soup in your picture.

1d5ieit,What can I do to utilize and / or preserve this bounty of perilla? ,94,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d5ieit,1717230524.0,"Seriously, this is a lot and I don‚Äôt want it to go to waste. It‚Äôs wild and reseeds prolifically. 
",34,questions,"You kind of have several stages of preservation to make these last as long as possible.

You can just pick and bag them in small stacks in ziplock bags. They can usually last a couple of weeks to a month in the crisper drawer.

For a little longer preservation you can make a kimchi or pickle it out of it. Recipes should be easy enough to find. Just look for ""[Kkaennip Kimchi](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/kkaennip-kimchi-perilla-kimchi/)""  or ""[Kkaennip Jangajji](https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-pickled-perilla-leaves-kkaennip-jangajji/)"".

For even longer preservation you can turn to the freezer. There are a bunch of options here.

You can make something like [Kkaennip-jangtteok](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kkaennip-jangtteok) or [Kkaennip-jeon](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kkaennip-jeon) and freeze them once you've cooked and cooled them down in a single layer on a tray. Once frozen you can bag into a ziplock. They're usually thin enough that you can reheat them from frozen over a low/medium heat in a frying pan.

You can also freeze a stew like Yeomso Tang/Boyang Tang/Yeongyang Tang etc. (they're all pretty similar) that is a lamb stew that uses the leaves, seeds (make sure to harvest those towards the end of the season) and the oil (you'll need to buy that). Recipes are kind of hard to come by in English though. However if you want to see what it's like and sort of muddle your way through the recipe, there's a [video like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3aIJlNeFNo). It's a delicious stew and freezes very well.

Lastly, if you're not sure what to do with it, you can just give it the frozen spinach treatment and just blanch, chill, squeeze excess water out and freeze in portions and then add that into any future stew like dwenjang jjigae, soup etc.

In terms of just utilisation, just use them fresh as wraps for grilled meats like you would with lettuce ssam wraps at KBBQ places. Any fried or grilled meat will work well with it, especially if it's a little on the richer/fattier side. | Share with friends.
